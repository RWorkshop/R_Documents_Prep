#### {Testing the slope (II)}

You can compute a
t test for that hypothesis simply by dividing the estimate by its standard
error
begin{equation}
t = frac{hat{beta}}{S.E.(hat{beta})}
end{equation}
which follows a t distribution on n - 2 degrees of freedom if the true $beta$ is
zero.

*  The standard $\chi^{2}$ test  in chisq.test works with data in matrix form, like fisher.test does.
*  For a 2 by 2 table, the test is exactly equivalent to prop.test.
