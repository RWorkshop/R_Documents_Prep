### R as a Calculator

<h5>Creating Data</h5>
Defining Variables 

* R is case sensitive.

A convention is to use define a variable name with a capital letter. This reduces the chance of overwriting inbuild R functions, which are usually written in lowercase letters.


Commonly used variable names such as x,y and z (in lower case letters) are not "reserved".

<pre><code>
x = 2           # create variable x and assign the value 2
y <- 4          # create variable y and assign the value 4
</code></pre>

##### Assignment

<pre><code>
5 -> z          # create variable z and assign the value 5
x  #print x to screen
y  #print y to screen
z  #print z to screen
</code></pre>



Remark: The value of each variable is prefaced with a " [1] ". This indicates that the value is a vector. More on that later.

### Basic Mathematical Calculations with R

We will briefly look at how R accomplished basic calculations.



<pre><code>
x*y			# multiplication
x/z			# division
x^2			# powers
sqrt(x)		# square root
exp(z)		 # exponentials   
log(y)		 # logarithms
pi             # returns the value of pi to six decimal places
</code></pre>

 
Complex numbers , Trigonometric  Functions and Binomial Coefficients


### Special Operators

Binomial coefficients are computed using the choose() command.


<pre><code>
J = -1 ;  sqrt(J)  ;  str(J) ;      # variable is defined as numeric, not complex.
K = -1 +0i ;  sqrt(K)  ;  str(K) ;  # variable is defined as complex .
sin(3.5*pi)             # correct answer is -1
cos(3.5*pi)             # correct answer is zero
 
choose(6,2)             # From 6 how many ways of choosing items.
</code></pre>

### useful operators

Factorials
$n! = n \times n-1 \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1 $
Binomial Coefficients
\[ { n \choose k }  = \frac{n!}{(n-k)! \times k!}\]

### Managing Precision

*  ``ceiling()`` Ceiling function of x, $\lceil x \rceil$.
*  ``round()`` Rounding a number to a specified number of decimal places.

### The Birthday function
The R command pbirthday() computes the probability of a coincidence of a number of randomly chosen people sharing a birthday, given that there are n people to choose from.
Suppose there are four people in a room. The probability of two of them sharing a birthday is computed as about 1.6 \%
<pre><code>
> pbirthday(4)
[1] 0.01635591
</code></pre>

How many people do you need for a greater than 50\% chance of a shared birthday? (choose from 23,43,63,83)?

#### {The Birthday function}
The R command ``pbirthday()`` computes the probability of a coincidence of a number of randomly chosen people sharing a birthday, given that there are $n$ people to choose from.
Suppose there are four people in a room. The probability of two of them sharing a birthday can be computed as follows: (Answer:  about 1.6 \%)
<code>
> pbirthday(4)
[1] 0.01635591
</code>


\noindent How many people do you need for a greater than 50\% chance of a shared birthday for n people? Many would make the guess 183 people.  Let us use the ``sapply()`` command. The first arguments is the data set (here a sequence of integers from 2 to 60) and then the command or function (here ``pbirthday()``, but specified without the brackets.
(starting from 2 – so the 5th element corresponds to 6 people, etc)
<code>
 > sapply(2:60,pbirthday)
 [1] 0.002739726 0.008204166 0.016355912 0.027135574

</code>
The answer is 23 people (see entry 22)- probably much less than you thought!!





Relational and Logical Operators
================================================
Column
---------------------


### Relational Operators

Relational operators allow for the comparison of values in vectors.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
greater than &	$>$\\
less than&	$<$\\
equal to	&$==$\\
less than or equal to&	$<=$\\
greater than or equal to&	$>=$\\
not equal to	&$!=$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

 	
 	

Note the difference of the equality operator "==" with assignment operator "=".

\& and \&\& indicate logical AND and $\|$ and $\|\|$ indicate logical OR.

The shorter form performs element-wise comparisons in much the same way as arithmetic operators. The longer form is appropriate for programming control-flow and typically preferred in "if" clauses.


*   We can use relational operators to subset vectors (as well as more complex data objects such as data frames, which we will meet later).
*   We specify the  relational condition in square brackets.
*   We can construct compound relational conditions too, using logical operators


<pre><code>

> vec=1:19
> vec[vec<5]
[1] 1 2 3 4
> vec[(vec<6)|(vec>16)]
[1]  1  2  3  4  5 17 18 19

</code></pre>



### Relational operators
A relational operator tests some kind of relation between two
entities. For $R$ the relational operators are as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline

  Equals & == & Less or equal to  & <= \\
  \hline
  Not Equal & != & Greater than & > \\
  \hline
  Less than & < & Greater than & >= \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}


###  {Logical operators}

*  The logical operators are AND, OR and NOT

*  if c1 and c2 are logical expressions, then $c1 \& c2$ is
their intersection (`AND'), $c1 | c2$ is their union (`OR'), and
$!c1$ is the negation of c1.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  AND & $ \& $ & also  & $\&\&$ \\
  \hline
  OR & $|$ & also & $||$ \\
  \hline
  NOT & $!$ & &  \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}


Sampling and Sequences
========================

Column {.tabset}
------------------------------

### Sequences


<h5> Generating Sequences </h5>

R has a number of ways to generate sequences of numbers. 
These include the simplest approach, using the the colon ":", e.g.


<pre><code>

> 1:10

[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

</code></pre>



### Sampling


* Vectors
* Creating numeric vector
* Programming Control Statements - FOR loops
* Basic Statistical Commands such as ``mean()`` and ``quantile()``

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
#### {Sequence of Integers}
A sequence of integers can be created using the “:” operator, specifying the upper and lower bounds on either side. This is very useful for Dice experiments. Importantly this sequence is constructed as a numeric vector.
<pre>
<code>
1:10
5:1
Dice = 1:6
Dice
class(Dice)
mode(Dice)
</code>
</pre>

<code>
> 1:10
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> 5:1
[1] 5 4 3 2 1
> Dice = 1:6
> Dice
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
> class(Dice)
[1] "integer"
> mode(Dice)
[1] "numeric"
</code>
We can also construct other sequences using the sequence of integers as part of the calculation.
<pre>
<code>
0:5
0:5 + 1
0:5 + 0.5
0:5/5
0:5*5
</code>
</pre>
<code>
> 0:5
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5
> 0:5 + 1
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
> 0:5 + 0.5
[1] 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
> 0:5/5
[1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0
> 0:5*5
[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25
> 
</code>
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
#### {Playing with Dice}

Another important command is the ``sample()`` command. This command causes ``R} to select $n$ items from the specified vector. We can use it to simulate one roll of a die.
<pre>
<code>
Dice = 1:6
sample(Dice,1)
</code>
</pre>
<code>
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 2 
> 
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 4 
>
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 1
> 
> sample(Dice,1)
[1] 2
</code>
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
#### {Sampling Without Replacement and With Replacement}
\noindent Suppose we wish to simulate two rolls of a die. Surely we just specify 2 in the argument of the ``sample()`` command. In fact we do, but this is not enough.
The ``sample()`` command works on the default basis of \textbf{\textit{sampling without replacement}}. That is to say: once a number has been selected, it can not be selected again.
<code>
> sample(Dice,6)
[1] 4 3 6 1 2 5
> sample(Dice,7)
Error in sample(Dice, 7) : 
  cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'
</code>
Sampling without replacement is appropriate if we are selecting lottery numbers. You can only pick a particular number once.
<code>
> Lotto=1:42
> sample(Lotto,6)
[1]  2 38 19 10  3 27
> 
</code>
Going back to multiple dice rolls, what we do here is to additionally specify ``replace=TRUE}. This specifies an experiment where there is \textbf{\textit{sampling with replacement}}. Let us simulate 20 dice rolls. We can also use the ``table()`` function to study the outcomes of the simulation. This command tells use how many times each outcome (number) came up. (This is called a \textbf{frequency table}). Out of interest, we will compute the mean value of the dice rolls using the ``mean()`` command.
<code>
> sample(Dice,20,replace=TRUE)
 [1] 4 1 3 2 5 4 4 4 6 5 6 6 5 6 6 5 1 1 1 3
>
> X= sample(Dice,20,replace=TRUE)
> table(X)
X
1 2 3 4 5 6 
4 4 2 3 3 4 
> mean(X)
[1] 3.45
</code>

Let us roll dice 300 times.  Each of the six outcome is equally likely,  so we will expect 50 realisations of each number.  But that rarely happens, as \textbf{Sampling fluctation} comes into play.
In the table below, we see that the number 2 comes up thirteen more times than the number 3. Is there something wrong? A hidden bias in our code? No. It is just a random occurence.

%-----------------------------------%
<code>
> X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> table(X)
X
 1  2  3  4  5  6 
48 57 44 55 51 45 
> mean(X)
[1] 3.463333
 hist(X,breaks=c(0:6 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green"))
</code>
 
A bar chart known as a \textbf{\textit{histogram}} to accompany this frequency table can be constructed using the following code. The command ``hist()`` is used to construct the histogram. The argument ``breaks} is used to specify the lower and upper bounds of each interval (the sides of each of the columns).
<pre>
<code>
 hist(X,breaks=c(0:6 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green"))
</code>
</pre>
%--------------------------------------%
#### {Rolling Two Dice}
So far we have simulated the roll of one die. Many games would use two dice rolled together, with an outcome between 2 and 12. A first guess would simply be to specify a certain numbers sampled with replacement from a sequence of integers 2 to 12. Wrong! 
For one die, each outcome is equally likely. For a two dice experiment, there are differences in the probability of each outcome occuring, with 2 and 12  being the least likely outcomes, while 7 is the most likely outcome.
Let roll two dice $X$ and $Y$ seperately, and then add the two numbers from each together (calling this addition $Z$.)


<pre>
<code>
X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
Y=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
Z=X+Y
table(Z)
hist(Z,breaks=c(1:12 + 0.5),col=c("red","blue","green","yellow"))
</code>
</pre>
<code>
> X=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> Y=sample(Dice,300,replace=TRUE)
> Z=X+Y
> table(Z)
Z
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 
 8 18 19 38 41 56 32 28 26 23 11
\end{veratim}



%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
#### {Dice Rolls Sums Experiment}
Let work on the basis of 100 dice rolls, and for the sake of simplicity let us consider the \textbf{sum} of those 100 single die-rolls. Importantly, we are simulating a \textbf{fair} die. The lowest mathematially possible value is 100, while the highest possible value is 600. We expect to get a value of approximately 350, halfway between the minimum and maximum, but each time we perform the experiment there will be slight fluctuations.  Try the last line of the code below a few times. How many times do you get a figure less than 340 or greater than 360?
<pre>
<code>
X= sample(Dice,100,replace=TRUE)
sum(X)

#Equivalently
sum(sample(Dice,100,replace=TRUE))
</code>
</pre>
