Notice how the rows and column are preceded with row and column indexes. To assign by row, we must specify it by setting the appropriate argument accordingly.

<pre>
<code>

#3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by row.
C= matrix(  c(1,6,7,0.6,0.5,0.3,1,2,1), ncol=3 , byrow =TRUE)

C
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]  1.0  6.0  7.0
[2,]  0.6  0.5  0.3
[3,]  1.0  2.0  1.0
</code>
</pre>

{Accessing Rows and Columns}
Particular rows and columns of a data object (matrix as well as other objects such as data frames) can be accessed by specifying the row number or column number, leaving the other value blank.
<pre>
<code>

A[1,]   # access first row of A
#[1] 1 6 5

C[,2]   # access second column of C
#[1] 6.0 0.5 2.0
</code>
</pre>

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%55


Naturally - particular elements may be accessed by specifying the row number and column number


<code>

A[1,1]
# [1] 1

# This is not just for matrices.
# It is for all suitable data objects.

iris[,1]
iris[,1:3]
iris[2,]
iris[2,3]

mtcars[2:5,4:6]
