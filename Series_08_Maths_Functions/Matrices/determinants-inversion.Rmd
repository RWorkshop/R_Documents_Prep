### Determinants, Inverse Matrices and solving Linear systems
To compute the determinant of a square matrix, we simply use the det() command

<pre><code>
det(A)
det(B)
</code></pre>
To find the inverse of a square matrix, we use the ``solve()`` command, specifying only the matrix in question




### Solving a System of Linear Equations
To solve a system of linear equations in the form Ax=b , where A is a square matrix, 
and b is a column vector of known values, we use the solve() command to determine 
the values of the unknown vector x.

<code>
b=vec2  # from before
solve(A, b)
</code>
