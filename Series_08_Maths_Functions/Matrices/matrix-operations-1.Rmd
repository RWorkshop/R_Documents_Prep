{Basic Matrix Calculations}


* [1)] Inverting a matrix

To invert a matrix we use the command solve() with no additional argument.

Remember - Not all matrices are invertible.  It the determinant of a matrix is zero, then no inverse exists.

<pre>
<code>
> solve(C)
            [,1]      [,2]       [,3]
[1,] -0.03333333  2.666667 -0.5666667
[2,] -0.10000000 -2.000000  1.3000000
[3,]  0.23333333  1.333333 -1.0333333
</code>
</pre>

We can use this same command to solve a system of linear equations Ax=b. We would specify the vector b as the additional argument.
(We will look at this matter more in the MATLAB component of the course).

* [2)] Computing the determinant

To compute the determinant, the command is simply det()


* [3)] Determining the dimensions

To find the dimensions of matrix A, we use the dim() command

* [4)] Compute the transpose

<pre>
<code>
det(C)
#[1] 3

dim(C) # number of rows and columns.
