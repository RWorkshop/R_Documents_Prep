*  When you start <tt>R</tt>, the command line interface window will appear on screen. This is one
 of many windows in the <tt>R</tt> environment, others including graphical output windows, or script
 editors. 
*  <tt>R</tt> code can be entered into the command line directly. 
*  Alternatively code can be saved
 to a script, which can be run inside a session using the \texttt{source()} function.
