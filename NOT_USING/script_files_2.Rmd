\textbf{Script Files}

* Scripts are saved as ``.R} files. 
* These scripts can be called directly using the ``source()`` command.

``source(myScript.R)}

``source(myDatasets.R)}

{1.10 Built-In Data Sets}
\textbf{Inbuilt Data Sets}\\
Several data sets , intended as learning tools, are automatically installed when R is installed.
Many more are installed within packages to complement learning to use those packages. \\


\textbf{iris}\\ One
of these is the famous Iris data set, which is used in many data mining exercises.


* airquality  ( very useful )
* mtcars
* Nile

More are available once packages are loaded.

* To see what data sets are available, simply type ``data()``.
*  To load a data set, simply type in the
name of the data set. Some data sets are very large.
*  To just see the first few (or last) rows, we
use the ``head()`` function or alternatively the ``tail()`` function. 
* The default number of rows of
these commands is 6. Other numbers can be specified.

* In many situations, it is useful to call a particular data set using the ``attach()`` command. This
will save having to specify the data sets over repeated operations. 
* The file can then be detached
using the ``detach()`` command.
