### Chi Square Test

*  We  use the Chi square test for testing association in two way
contingency tables.
*  ***Contingency tables***: Outcomes are categorized into rows and columns.
*  This can be used to test the differences between several groups.
*  The null hypothesis is that there is not differences between the groups.
*  The alternative is that there is difference between the groups.
*  Is there Independence or Association?


## Working with Categorical Data

### Chi-Square

The table below shows the relationship between gender and party identification in a US state.

%   & Democrat &Independent & Republican & Total \\
%Male   &279& 73  &225 &577 \\
%Female &165& 47  & 191 &403 \\
%Total  &444 & 120 &416&   980 \\

Test for association between gender and party affiliation at two appropriate levels
and comment on your results.

Set out the null hypothesis that there is no association between method of computation
and gender against the alternative, that there is. Be careful to get these the correct way
round!

H0: There is no association.
H1: There is an association.

Work out the expected values. For example, you should work out the expected value for
the number of males who use no aids from the following: (95/195) × 22 = 10.7.


------------------------------


<pre><code>
chisq.test(c(59,20,11,10))

chisq.test(c(59,20,11,10), p=c(9/16,3/16,3/16,1/16))


library(MASS)     # load the MASS package

tbl = table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer)
</code></pre>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 3. Chi-squared Test of Independence
Two random variables x and y are called independent if the probability distribution of one variable is not affected by the presence of another.

* Assume fij is the observed frequency count of events belonging to both i-th category of x and j-th category of y. 
* Also assume eij to be the corresponding expected count if x and yare independent. 
* The null hypothesis of the independence assumption is to be rejected if the p-value of the following Chi-squared test statistics is less than a given significance level α.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<h5>Example</h5>
In the embedded data set “survey”, the Smoke column records the students smoking habit, while the Exer column records their exercise level. The allowed values in Smoke are "Heavy", "Regul" (regularly), "Occas" (occasionally) and "Never". As for Exer, they are "Freq" (frequently), "Some" and "None".

We can tally the students smoking habit against the exercise level with the table function in R. The result is called the contingency table of the two variables.
 
<pre><code>

> library(MASS)       # load the MASS package 
> tbl = table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer) 
> tbl                 # the contingency table 
 
        Freq None Some 
  Heavy    7    1    3 
  Never   87   18   84 
  Occas   12    3    4 
  Regul    9    1    7
</code></pre>

### Problem
Test the hypothesis whether the students smoking habit is independent of their exercise level at 0.05 significance level.

#### Solution
We apply the chisq.test function to the contingency table tbl, and found the p-value to be 0.4828.
<pre><code>
> chisq.test(tbl) 
 
        Pearson’s Chi-squared test 
 
data:  table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer) 
X-squared = 5.4885, df = 6, p-value = 0.4828 
 
Warning message: 
In chisq.test(table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer)) : 
  Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
</code></pre>
Answer
As the p-value 0.4828 is greater than the .05 significance level, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the smoking habit is independent of the exercise level of the students.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h4>Enhanced Solution</h4>
The warning message found in the solution above is due to the small cell values in the contingency table. To avoid such warning, we combine the second and third columns of tbl, and save it in a new table named ctbl. Then we apply the chisq.test function against ctblinstead.
<pre><code> 
> ctbl = cbind(tbl[,"Freq"], tbl[,"None"] + tbl[,"Some"]) 
> ctbl 
      [,1] [,2] 
Heavy    7    4 
Never   87  102 
Occas   12    7 
Regul    9    8 
 
> chisq.test(ctbl) 
 
        Pearson’s Chi-squared test 
 
data:  ctbl 
X-squared = 3.2328, df = 3, p-value = 0.3571
</code></pre>

### Smoking Example 

Using this in-built dataset, we shall test the association between smoking and exercise.


Test the hypothesis whether the students smoking habit is independent of their exercise level at 0.05 significance level.


```{r}
library(MASS)       # load the MASS package 
tbl = table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer) 
tbl                 # the contingency table 

# Notice the small cell sizes

```

```{r}
class(survey$Smoke)

# Sort the factors

levels(survey$Smoke)=c('Never','Occas','Regul','Heavy')
levels(survey$Exer)=c('None','Some','Freq')
```

### Chi Square Test for Independence


```{r}
chisq.test(tbl) 

```

*  We have applied the <tt>chisq.test()</tt> function to the contingency table tbl, and found the p-value to be 0.4828.
*  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.


*  The warning message found in the solution above is due to the small cell values in the contingency table. 
*  To avoid such warning, we could combine the second and third columns of tbl.

```{r}

# Dont throw out the raw data,make a 'derived variable' instead.
survey$Exer2 <- survey$Exer

levels(survey$Exer2) <- list(Rare = c('None','Some'),Freq = 'Freq')

```

```{r}
chisq.test(survey$Smoke,survey$Exer2)
```

### <tt>prob.table()</tt>

A useful command associated with the Chi-Square Test is <tt>prob.table()</tt>, whicn converts count data to proportions.

```{r}
### OVerall Proportions
prop.table(tbl) 
```


```{r}
### Proportion of Row Variable
prop.table(tbl,1) 
```


```{r}
### Proportion of Column Variable
prop.table(tbl,2) 
```
