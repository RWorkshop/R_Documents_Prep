Q. 1) The following amounts are the sizes of claims (in INR) on house insurance policies for a 
certain type of repair. 
1990, 2400, 2150, 2090, 2300, 2100, 2180, 2150, 2030, 2100, 2180, 2010, 2060, 2160, 2120 
1.  Enter data in R. (1)
2.   Calculate Q1, Q2, Q3 and Inter-quartile range. (4)
3.  Determine the sample mean and variance of the data. 
4. Test the hypothesis whether the mean claim amount is equal to INR 2000 and comment 
on the results. 
5. Assuming the data to be normally distributed, calculate the probability of a claim amount 
exceeding INR 2300. 
 
6.  Calculate the revised mean and median after removing the largest two values from the 
dataset. Comment on the result. (6)

### Question 2
 
Q. 2) The prior and posterior distribution for values of systolic blood pressure follows Normal 
distribution. Prior distribution of systolic blood pressure (x) has a mean of 120 and standard 
deviation of 10. 

#### Exercises 
1.  Generate range of values of x in the interval [80,160] and using len = 100. (3)
2.   Plot the posterior probability density function of x using answer from (1. . (6)
3.  Perform a simulation of 1000 posterior samples for the parameter x. 
4. Plot a histogram of the posterior distribution of x. (3)
5. What is the mean and standard deviation of posterior distribution of x? 
6.  Calculate the 95% confidence interval for systolic blood pressure using the posterior 
distribution. 
### Question 3
Q. 3) An agency has collected data on the number of COVID19 cases of two cities in order to 
analyse the similarities & differences between them. Below is the data for two cities on 
monthly basis. 
Month City A City B 
1 9150 8919 
2 9418 9095 
3 9218 9046 
4 9539 9321 
5 9179 9719 
6 8907 9704 
7 9472 9107 
8 8921 9275

1.  Enter data in R. 
2.   Test at 5% level with clearly mentioning the hypothesis, if there is a difference in the 
mean of the two sample data assuming equal & unknown variance. (8)
3.  Test whether the variances are equal at 5% level and comment on the results. 
4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means. (3)
5. Comment on your findings in part 2.   and part (4.. 
### Question 4


<h4> Question 4</h4>

#### Part 2

Calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between Sales and Spend of the company. 


#### Part 3


Perform a hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that Pearson’s population correlation 
coefficient is equal to zero, against the alternative that it is positive. You should report the 
p-value of the test and a clear conclusion. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 4) Five years of marketing spend and company sales by month 
1.  Construct a scatterplot of the data. Comment on the relationship between the Sales & 
Spend based on the plot. 
2.   Calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between Sales and Spend of the company. 
3.  Perform a hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that Pearson’s population correlation 
coefficient is equal to zero, against the alternative that it is positive. You should report the 
p-value of the test and a clear conclusion. 
4. Perform a simple linear regression analysis on the data. Your answer should report the 
estimate of parameter sigma. 
5. Plot the fitted line on the data scatterplot. 
6.  State the proportion of the total variability of the responses explained by the model based 
on your output in (4.. 
7.    Plot a graph of the residuals of the model fitted in (4. against the explanatory variable. 
8.   Obtain a 99% confidence interval for parameter sigma. 
ix) Comment on the validity of the model based on results in part 7.    and part (8.  . 
x) Calculate the p-value of a hypothesis test for this suggestion (slope equal to 10), by 
creating a suitable test statistic. (7)
x1.  Comment on the suggestion in point (x). 
x2.  Calculate the predicted amount of sales when the marketing spend is INR 4500.
