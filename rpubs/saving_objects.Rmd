 In situations where a good deal of processing must be used on a raw dataset in order to prepare
 it for analysis, it may be prudent to save the R objects you create in their internal binary form.
 One attractive feature of this scheme is that the objects created can be read by R programs
 running on different computer architectures than the one on which they were created, making it
 very easy to move your data between different computers. Each time an R session is completed,
 you are prompted to save the workspace image, which is a binary file called .RData in the
 working directory.
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 Whenever R encounters such a file in the working directory at the beginning of a session,
 it automatically loads it making all your saved objects available again. So one method for
 
 saving your work is to always save your workspace image at the end of an R session. If you
 would like to save your workspace image at some other time during your R session, you can use
 the save.image() function, which, when called with no arguments, will also save the current
 workspace to a file called .RData in the working directory.

 The Holy Trinity
 
*  texttt{help()}
*  texttt{summary()}

### {2.2 Changing GUI options}
 
*  We can change the GUI options using the GUI preferences option on the Edit menu.
 *  (Important
 when teaching R) 
*  A demonstration will be done in class.

### {2.3 Colours}
 
*  R supported a massive number of colours.
*  Type in colours() (or colors()) to see what colours
 are supported.

### {2.4 Use of the Semi-Colon Operator}
 
*  The semi-colon operator at the end of each line of code is not necessary in general, but using it
 overcomes errors due to copying and pasting from document soft copies. 
*  It is also useful for compacting multiple short statements onto a single line.
*  In other programming
 languages, such as Octave, using the semicolon in this way has a distinct purpose.
