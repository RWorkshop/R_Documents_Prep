<h4>The R Programming Language</h4>
R is a flexible language that is object oriented and thus allows the manipulation of a complex
data structures in a condensed and efficient manner.
 
R's graphical abilities are also remarkable with possible interfacing with text processors such as
Latex with the package sweave.
R offers the addtional advantage of being a free and opensource system under the GNU general
public licence.

R is primarily a statistical language.
R can be installed free of charge from www.r-project.org

An online guide "An Introduction to R" can be access by typing
help.start() at the command prompt to access this.

<h4>Defining variables</h4>
R is case sensitive.
A convention is to use define a variable name with a capital letter.
This reduces the chance of overwriting inbuild R functions, which are usually written in lowercase letters.


Functions in R can be treated as "objects" that can be manipulated or used recursively.

R shares many aspects with both Object orietnated and Functional programming langguages.
all data in R is stored an objects, which have a range of "\texttt{methods}" available.
The "class" of an object can be found using the class() function.
Using the Help functions
Embedded help commands "help()" and "help.search()" are good starting points to gather information. 
Note that "help.search()" opens a web browser linked to the local manual pages.

<h4>Introduction to R</h4>


R is a statistical Environment for statistical computing and graphics, which is available for windows, Unix and Mac OS platforms.

R is maintained and distributed by an international team of statisticians and computers scientists.

R is one of the major tools used in statistical research and in applications of statistics research.

R is the product of an active movement among statisticians for a powerful, programmable, portable, and open computing environment, applicable to the most complex and sophsticated problems, as well as “routine” analysis.

R is open source. There is very little restriction on access or use for practitioners.

Practitioners have implemented hundreds of specialized statistical procedures for a wide variety of applications as contributed packages, which are also freely-available and which integrate directly into R. ( We will look at those shortly).

<h4>Advantages of R</h4>

1. It is completely free and will always be so, since it is issued under the GNU Public License;
2. It is freely-available over the internet;
3. It runs on almost all operating systems, including Unix and derivatives including Darwin, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris; and most flavours of Microsoft Windows;
4. It is the product of international collaboration between top computational statisticians and computer language designers;
5. It allows statistical analysis and visualisation of unlimited sophistication; you are not restricted to a small set of procedures or options, and because of the contributed packages, you are not limited to one method of accomplishing a given computation or graphical presentation;

<h4>Starting R</h4>


R can be started in the usual way by double-clicking on the R icon on the desktop.

R works best if you have a dedicated folder for each separate project - called the working folder.

Create the directory/folder that will be used as the working folder, e.g. create a folder on your desktop titled Your_name by right-clicking, then clicking New > Folder.

Right-click on an existing R icon and click Copy. 

In the working folder, right-click and click Paste. 

The R icon will appear in the folder.

<h4>The R environment</h4>



If a command is not complete at the end of a line, R will give a different prompt, by default:
"+" on second and subsequent lines and continue to read input until the command is syntactically complete.

In particular functions in R are treated as objects that can be manipulated or used recursively, example TSA book3
In common with functional languages, assignments in R can be avoided, but they are useful for clarity and convenience. 
In addition R runs faster when loops are avoided, which can often be achieved using matrix calculation instead however, thus results in obscure looking code.
