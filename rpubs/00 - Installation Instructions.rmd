Installing Packages
===================================================
Thanks for your interest in the Coding Grace `R` workshop. 

In order to prepare for the workshop, we ask you to try out the following three steps before the workshop. 
If you are not able to, we can met up the workshop (at 9am Starbucks on Westland Row) and help you with it.

### Step 1
In advance of the workshop, it would be great if you could install R.
R can be installed for this website.

http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/cran.r-project.org/

The process is very simple, and should only take two or three minutes. Select the default options when necessary.

### Step 2 - Rstudio

Later in the presentation, we hope to show you some great techniques to present the results of your analysis. 
To do this - we ask you to download and install Rstudio from this website.

Again the process should be very quick.

### Step 3 - Important R packages

In advance of the workshop install some `R` packages that we will use on the day.

All you have to do is to open `R` (making sure that you are connected to the internet), and run the following piece of code
( you can copy-and-paste this following code segment)


```{r}

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("nycflights13")
install.packages("knitr")

```

R packages can also be installed from R Studio by clicking on the ***Tools*** menu and selecting install packages. A dialogue will appear.
