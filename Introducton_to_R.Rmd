### The R Programming Language

* R is an open-source statistical package based on the S language. It is a powerful computing tool that combines the usefulness of a statistical analysis package with that of a publication quality graphics package and a matrix-based programming language. 
* It's easy enough to use for quick and simple tasks, yet powerful enough for the most demanding ones. 
* The goal of this demonstration is to provide a basic introduction to using R. An R session differs from that of other statistical software. You will find it to be an interactive approach where the results from one step lead to the next. 
* This introduction to R is necessarily limited in scope to only a handful of analyses. 
* Once you become familiar with R and browse through some of the online help topics, you will discover tools for practically any type of analysis you need. S-PLUS is a commercial application also based on the S language. Much of R is identical to the command line useage of S-PLUS. There are differences though in some functions and their arguments so existing S-PLUS code may require some modification to run in R.

5. Using R's help commands

#### What is R?
R is a statistical Environment for statistical computing and graphics, and is one of the major tools used in statistical research and in applications of statistics research. 

R is a suite of software facilities for:
•	reading and manipulating data (our focus)
•	computation
•	conducting statistical analyses
•	displaying the results graphically (useful packages like ggplot2)

R is an open-source (GPL) statistical environment modelled after S and S-Plus, maintained and distributed by the R core-development team: an international volunteer team of statisticians and computers scientists. 

(We can find out more about them by using the command contributors() a little later on)

Statisticians and data scientists have implemented hundreds of specialised statistical procedures, known as Packages, for a wide variety of applications as contributed packages, which are also freely-available and which integrate directly into R.

More about Packages later (much more!!)
 
The S language was developed in the late 1980s at AT&T labs. The R project was started by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the Statistics Department of the University of Auckland in 1995. R has quickly gained a widespread audience across the world. 

R is the product of an active movement among statisticians for a powerful, programmable, portable, and open computing environment, applicable to the most complex and sophisticated problems, as well as more “routine”analysis.

#### Using R

R offers the additional advantage of being a free and open-source system under the GNU general public licence, available for windows, Unix and Mac OS platforms. 

The R project web page ( http://www.r-project.org ) is the main site for information on R. At this site are directions for downloading the software, accompanying packages and other sources of documentation.

R is a flexible language that is object oriented and thus allows the manipulation of a complex data structures in a condensed and efficient manner.

In common with functional languages, assignments in R can be avoided, but they are useful for clarity and convenience. 

In addition R runs faster when loops are avoided, which can often be achieved using matrix calculation instead however, thus results in obscure looking code.

Additionally there are alternatives to “loops” that improve the readability of code, from the point of view of the user.

R's graphical abilities are also remarkable (with packages like “lattice” and “ggplot2”), with possible interfacing with text processors such as Latex with the package “SWeave”.


An online guide "An Introduction to R" is automatically installed and can be easily accessed at any time (by typing help.start()at the command prompt). 

We will go into detail on using the help systems for R later.


Key points:

•	R is easily downloadable from www.r-project.org

•	R packages are also accessible from the R website.

•	A user manual can be accessed by typing help.start()

•	Matrix calculations will be key programming approach.



 
#### Working with R
R is most easily used in an interactive manner, typing code into the command line and R gives you an response. 

Questions are asked and answered on the command line. 

R can be started in the usual way by double-clicking on the R icon on the desktop.

The following text will appear at the top of the screen. Let’s try out some demonstrations – particularly the graphics ones.


Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

#### The prompt

The > is called the prompt, used to indicate where you are to type. 

If a command is not complete at the end of a line, R will give the "+" prompt on second and subsequent lines and continue to read input until the command is syntactically complete.

Commands are separated either by a semi-colon (;), or by a newline. 

Elementary commands can be grouped together into one compound expression by braces ({ and }). 

Comments can be put almost anywhere, starting with a hashmark (#); everything after "#" is a comment.

The R console opens with information and then a prompt mark  (“ > “),  ready to accept commands.

Commenting and Colour Schemes
Comments can be put almost anywhere, starting with a hashmark (#); everything after "#" is a comment.

Conventionally inputted material, such as codes and comments are coloured red. Computer output is coloured blue.

The Assignment operator

The assignment operator is a "=". This is valid as of R version 1.4.0. Previously it was (and still can be) a "<-".

Both will be used, although, you should learn one and stick with it. 
Many long term R users prefer the second approach.
You can also use "->" as an assignment operator, reversing the usual assignment positions.

Defining Variables 
A convention is to use define a variable name with a capital letter (R is case sensitive). 

This reduces the chance of overwriting in-build R functions, which are usually written in lowercase letters.

Commonly used variable names such as x,y and z (in lower case letters) are not "reserved".


x = 2           # create variable x and assign the value 2
y <- 4          # create variable y and assign the value 4
5 -> z          # create variable z and assign the value 5

x  #print x to screen
y  #print y to screen
z  #print z to screen

Remark:
The value of each variable is prefaced with a " [1] ". This is because the value that is presented is a vector. The value in square brackets indicates the index of the nearest data value. A vector may contain only one data value. More on that later.

Data may be numeric values, characters or logical values. 

•	Numeric values are simply numbers. 
•	Characters are letters or short groups of letters enclosed in quotation marks.
•	The logical values are TRUE or FALSE respectively (with no quotation marks)

All data in R is stored as “objects”, which have a range of "methods" available. The "class" of an object can be found using the class() function.

The function str() can also be used to identify the type of an existing variable.

> a=1
> str(a)
 num 1
>
> b="kevin"
> class(b)
[1] "character"
>
> c=TRUE
> str(c)
 logi TRUE

 
Basic Calculations

We will briefly look at how R accomplished basic calculations. 


x=10 ; y =5 ; z=2

x*y			# multiplication
x/z			# division

x^2			# powers
sqrt(x)		# square root

exp(z)		# exponentials   
log(y)		# logarithms

pi             # returns the value of pi to 6 decimal places

 
R can handle more advanced calculations too, such as complex numbers , trigonometric functions, factorials and binomial coefficients.

When working with complex numbers, the data type needs to specified as complex, rather than numeric. 

Binomial coefficients (e.g. 6C2) are computed using the choose() command.


J = -1   
sqrt(J)  
str(J)      # variable is defined as numeric, not complex.

K = -1 +0i 
sqrt(K)  
str(K)      # variable is defined as complex .


sin(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is -1
cos(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is zero
 

factorial(6)      # Factorial

choose(6,2)       # From 6 how many ways of choosing 2 items.
Installed Data sets
To assist in the demonstration of statistical methodologies, there are several dozen embedded data sets installed automatically with R.
To view the list of such data sets currently available, type in data() to the command line.
One data set we will be using frequently is the Iris data set.

(To view the column names, and the first six cases, we will use the command head(). To view the last six cases, use the command tail() ).

data()

iris

head(iris)

While we will be covering very little material relevant to graphics, it is worth nothing how many colours are supported by R.  To get a full list of currently supported colours, type in the command colours().




Using R's help commands
As mentioned earlier, R has an inbuilt help facility. To get more information on any specific named function, for example “boxplot”, the command is: “?boxplot” or “help(boxplot)”

>?boxplot		  # access help on boxplots
>help(Im)        # access help on "Im"

A description of the package – as well as some demonstration code – are provided.

Try out the demonstration code.

On most R installations help is available in HTML format by running help.start() which will launch a Web browser that allows the help pages to be browsed with hyperlinks. 
 

>help.start()


There is also an “apropos” function. This command returns a list of the names of all objects matching the argument. This is very useful for finding out what commands and functions are available.
Suppose we want to find out a way of performing a correlation analysis. Use “cor” as the argument (short, but not too short).

> apropos("cor")
[1] ".__C__recordedplot" "cancor"             "cor"               
[4] "cor.test"           "cov2cor"            "Harman23.cor"      
[7] "Harman74.cor"       "recordGraphics"     "recordPlot"    




##############################
Generating Sequences 
R has a number of ways to generate sequences of numbers. 
These include the simplest approach, using the the colon ":", e.g.

> 1:10
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

### {1.9 Basic ***R*** Editor}
 
*  To start a new script, or open an existing script simply go to File and click the appropriate
 options. A new dialogue box will appear. 
 
*  You can write and edit code using this editor.
*  To pass the code for compiling , press the run line or selection option (The third icon
 on the menu).
 
 
 -----------------------------------===========================================================================================%
 
 
 
*  Another way to read code is to use the texttt{edit()} function, which operates directly from the
 command line. 
*  To see how the code defining an object X was written (or more importantly,
 could have been written) simply type texttt{edit(X)}. 
*  This command has some useful applications
 that we will see later on (the texttt{scan()} command).
 
 
 
### {Script Files}
 
*  Scripts are saved as texttt{.R} files. 
*  These scripts can be called directly using the texttt{source()} command.
 
 
 <pre>
 texttt{source(myScript.R)}
 
 texttt{source(myDatasets.R)}
 
 texttt{source(myFunctions.R)}

\end{figure}
  
-----------------------------------


{1.2 Command Line Interface}

* When you start <tt>R</tt>, the command line interface window will appear on screen. This is one
of many windows in the <tt>R</tt> environment, others including graphical output windows, or script
editors. 
* <tt>R</tt> code can be entered into the command line directly. 
* Alternatively code can be saved
to a script, which can be run inside a session using the ``source()`` function.


-----------------------------------

{1.3 The Assignment operator}

* The assignment operator is used to assign names to particular values. 
* Historically the assignment
operator was ) a ````$<-$}”. 
* The assignment operator can also be the equals sign "=". (This is valid as of <tt>R</tt>
version 1.4.0.)

* Both will be used, although, you should learn one and stick with it. Many long term <tt>R</tt>
users prefer the arrow approach. 



-----------------------------------

{1.3 The Assignment operator}

* You can also use $->$ as an assignment operator, reversing the
usual assignment positions. (This is actually really useful).
* Commands are separated either by
a semi colon or by a newline.

\end{figure}



-----------------------------------

{1.3 The Assignment operator}
\textbf{The Up and Down Keys}

* Before we continue, try using the up and down keys, and see what happens. 
* Previously
typed commands are re-presented, and can be re-executed.



-----------------------------------

{1.3 The Assignment operator }
\textbf{objects}

* R stores both data and output from data analysis (as well as everything else) in \textbf{objects}.
* The variables we have created so far are objects. 
* A list of all objects in the current session can
be obtained with ``ls()``.


#### Reserved Words - Bad names for Objects

* Some names are used by the system, e.g.``T, F,q,c} etc . 
* Avoid using these. (This is the rule I broke earlier on)
* Also avoid using command names like \textbf{mean} and \textbf{sum}



  
-----------------------------------

### Commenting

* For the sake of readability, it is good practice to comment code. The \# character at the
beginning of a line signifies a comment, which is not executed. Lines of hashtags can be used
to identify the beginning and end of code segments
\begin{figure}

-----------------------------------

### Defining and Naming Variables

* A convention is to use define a variable name with a capital letter (R is case sensitive). 
* This
reduces the chance of overwriting in-build <tt>R</tt> functions, which are usually written in lowercase
letters. 
* Commonly used variable names such as x, y and z (in lower case letters) are not “reserved”.

\textbf{Camel Case}
\begin{framed}
``camelCase}

``variableName}

``AlsoCamelCase}
\end{framed}


-----------------------------------


{1.6 Help Functions}

*  Help files for R functions are accessed by preceding the name of the function with ?\\  (e.g. ``?sort}
). 

* Alternatively you can use the command ``help()`` (e.g. ``help(sqrt)} )



-----------------------------------


{1.6 Help Functions}

* A HTML document appears on screen with information on the function typed in. 
* As well
as the list of arguments that the particular function accepts, and how to specify them, there is
example code at the bottom of the file. 
* These code segments are often invaluable in learning
how to master the function.

{1.8 Basic Maths Operations}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
The most commonly used mathematical operators are all supported by <tt>R</tt>. \\  Here are a few
examples:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
$5 + 3 \ast 5$ &  Note the order of operations.\\\hline
log (10) & Natural logarithm with base e=2.718282 \\\hline
log(8,2) & Log to the base 2 \\\hline
$4^2$ & 4 raised to the second power \\\hline
7/2 & Division \\\hline
factorial(4) & Factorial of Four \\\hline
sqrt (25) & Square root \\\hline
abs (3-7) & Absolute value of 3-7 \\\hline
pi & The mysterious number \\\hline
exp(2) & exponential function \\\hline

\end{tabular} 


-----------------------------------


<tt>R</tt> can be used for many mathematical operations, including


* Set Theory
* Trigonometry
* Complex Numbers
* Binomial Coefficients

Set Theory is always useful to know (Monty Hall Problem). We will not go into any of the others in great detail today.


-----------------------------------

### Basic <tt>R</tt> Editor 

* <tt>R</tt> has an inbuilt script editor. We will use it for this class, but there are plenty of top quality
Integrated Development Environments out there. (Read up about ***Rstudio*** for example).
* For a while, we will use the in-built script editor. Although it is advisable to start using ***Rstudio*** or something similar in the not-too-distant future.
