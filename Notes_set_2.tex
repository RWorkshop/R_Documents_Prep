Basic statistics in R

Summary statistics of a data set can be obtained from summary, or by using individual commands
like mean, sd, mad, and IQR. Standard hypothesis tests are also available, e.g., t.test
yields the standard tests for means of one or two normal samples. 
 
Probability distributions in R.

Standard probability distributions have short names in R as given by Table 2.1. Several
probability functions are available. Their names consists of two parts: the first part is the
name of the function (see Table 2.2), while the second part is the name as in Table 2.1.
E.g., a sample of size 10 from an exponential distribution with mean 3 is generated in R by
rexp(10,1/3) (R uses the failure intensity instead of the mean as parameter).
