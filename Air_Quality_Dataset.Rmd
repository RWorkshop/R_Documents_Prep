# Exercise: The Air Quality Data Set

A data frame with 154 observations on 6 variables:

| Variable   | Type     | Description                        |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| `Ozone`    | numeric  | Ozone (ppb)                        |
| `Solar.R`  | numeric  | Solar Radiation (lang)             |
| `Wind`     | numeric  | Wind speed (mph)                   |
| `Temp`     | numeric  | Temperature (°F)                   |
| `Month`    | numeric  | Month (1–12)                       |
| `Day`      | numeric  | Day of the month (1–31)            |

## Sample R Commands

```r
tail(airquality)
help(airquality)
```

## Exercises

1. For each variable, how many missing values are there?
2. How many complete cases are there?
3. What is the variance of each of the continuous variables?
4. How many complete cases are there (i.e., rows with no missing values)?
5. If you exclude the `Wind` variable, how many complete cases remain?

## Complete Cases in R

For a data frame with \( n \) rows, the function `complete.cases()` returns a logical vector of length \( n \), indicating which rows have no missing values.

You can convert logical vectors (`TRUE`, `FALSE`) into numeric values (`1`, `0`) using `as.numeric()`:

```r
X <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(X)
# [1] 1 1 0 0 1
```
