# Basic Concepts

In *survival analysis* we analyse *time-to-event* data and try to estimate the
underlying distribution of times for events to occur.

## Introduction

For the purposes of this workshop, we focus on a single event type, but the
topic is wide and broadly applicable.


### Workshop Materials

All materials for this workshop is available in my standard GitHub repo:

The content of this workshop is partly based on the book "Applied Survival
Analysis Using R" by Dirk F. Moore. The data from this book is available from
CRAN via the package 'asaur'.


### Example Datasets

This workshop will use a number of different time-to-event datasets, so we
look at those first.

#### Telco Churn Data

The telco churn data contains some customer usage information on mobile phone
customers and whether or not they left their subscription accounts.

```{r show_telco_churn_data, echo=TRUE}
telco_churn_tbl %>% glimpse()

telco_churn_tbl %>% head()
```


#### Prostate Survival

The prostate survival data is generated data from a cancer survival study.

```{r show_prostate_data, echo=TRUE}
prostate_surv_tbl %>% glimpse()

prostate_surv_tbl %>% head()
```

#### Smoker Data

The smoker data is a smoking relapse study involving a number of different
treatments and details on when and if the patient resumed smoking.

```{r show_smoker_data, echo=TRUE}
pharmaco_smoker_tbl %>% glimpse()

pharmaco_smoker_tbl %>% head()
```



## Basic Principles  

### Data Censoring and Truncation

In the problems we work on, our data observation process does not allow us to
fully observe the variable in question. Instead, our observations are often
*right-censored* - that is, we know the value in question is at least the
observed value, but it may also be higher.

Expressing this formally, suppose $T^*$ is the time to event, and $U$ is the
time to the censoring, the our observed time $T$, and censoring indicator,
$\delta$, are given by

\begin{eqnarray*}
T      &=& \min(T^*, U) \\
\delta &=& I[T^* \leq U]
\end{eqnarray*}


A less common phenomenon is *left-censoring* - where we observe the event to be
at most a given duration. This may happen in medical studies where continual
observation of the patients is not possible or feasible.

### Hazard and Survival Functions

Our key goal is to find the survival distribution - the distribution of times
from some given start point to the time of the event.

Two common ways of specifying this distribution are the *survival function*,
$S(t)$ and the *hazard function*, $h(t)$.

$S(t)$ is the probability of surviving to time $t$, so is defined as follows:

$$
S(t) = P(T > t), \, 0 \leq t \leq \infty
$$

Thus, $S(0) = 1$ and decreases monotonically with time $t$. As it is a
probability it is non-negative.

We can also define the survival function in terms of the instantaneous failure
rate, the probability of failing at exactly time $t$. More formally,

$$
\lambda(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T \leq t + \delta \; | \, T > t)}{\delta}
$$

This is also called the *intensity function* or the *force of mortality*


### Cumulative Functions

Some analyses make it easier to use the *cumulative hazard function* 

$$
\Lambda(t) = \int^t_0 \lambda(u) \, du
$$

As a consequence of this definition we also have

$$
S(t) = \exp(- \Lambda(t))
$$

### Mean and Median Survival

Finally, two common statistics for survival are the *mean survival time* and
the *median survival time*:

The mean survival time is the expected value of the distribution, using
standard probability definitions:

$$
\mu = E(T) = \int^\infty_0 t f(t) \, dt = \int^\infty_0 S(t) \, dt
$$

The median survival time, $t_{\text{med}}$ such that

$$
S(t_{\text{med}}) = 0.5
$$
