## Lists

A **list** in R is a flexible data structure that can contain elements of different types: vectors, matrices, strings, booleans, and even other lists.

```r
# Example list
x <- list(
  a = 1:10,
  beta = exp(-3:3),
  logic = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
)
```

Each element in the list is referred to as a **component**.

## The Apply Family

The `apply()` family of functions provides vectorized alternatives to loops, making R code cleaner and faster.

### 1. `apply()`

Used primarily with matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. Syntax:

```r
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)
```

- `X`: the matrix
- `MARGIN`: 1 = rows, 2 = columns
- `FUN`: the function to apply

---

### 2. `lapply()`

Applies a function to each element of a **list** and returns a list.

```r
lapply(x, mean)
```

**Output:**

```r
$a
[1] 5.5

$beta
[1] 4.535125

$logic
[1] 0.5
```

---

### 3. `sapply()`

A user-friendly version of `lapply()` that tries to simplify the output (e.g., into a vector or matrix if possible).

```r
sapply(x, mean)
```

**Output:**

```r
       a     beta    logic
5.500000 4.535125 0.500000
```
