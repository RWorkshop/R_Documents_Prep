<h3>While Loops</h3>
==================================================
The while loop can be used if the number of iterations required is not known beforehand. 
For example, if we want to continue looping until a certain condition is met, a while loop is useful.
		
The following is the syntax for a while loop:
		
<pre><code>
		while (condition){
		command
		command
		}
<code><pre>
		The loop continues while \texttt{condition == TRUE}.

<h5>While Loops in <code>R</code></h5>
The <code>while</code> operator allows a set of commands to be repeated until a specific logical condition is met.

Importantly the logical condition you specify as an argument is the opposite of what you are trying to do.

<pre><code>while( logical condition is meet)</code></pre>
