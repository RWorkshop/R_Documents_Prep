# Working with Dates and Times in R

Handling dates and times is essential for time series analysis, logging, and data wrangling. R provides both base functions and powerful packages like `lubridate` and `hms` to simplify this process.

## Base R Date-Time Functions

### `Sys.Date()`

Returns the current system date.

```r
Sys.Date()
# [1] "2023-09-16"
```

### `Sys.time()`

Returns the current system date and time.

```r
Sys.time()
# [1] "2023-09-16 09:08:57 BST"
```

### Checking Object Classes

```r
class(Sys.Date())
# [1] "Date"

class(Sys.time())
# [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt"
```

### Converting Strings to Dates

```r
as.Date("2021-10-10")
# [1] "2021-10-10"
```

## Using the `lubridate` Package

The `lubridate` package simplifies parsing and manipulating date-time objects.

### `ymd()` â€” Parse Year-Month-Day Format

```r
library(lubridate)

ymd("2021-10-10")
# [1] "2021-10-10"
```

Other useful functions include:
- `mdy()` for Month-Day-Year
- `dmy()` for Day-Month-Year

---

## Using the `hms` Package

The `hms` package is useful for handling time-of-day values (hours, minutes, seconds).

```r
library(hms)

as_hms("12:34:56")
# 12:34:56
```
