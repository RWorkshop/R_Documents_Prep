# 1. Introduction

In this tutorial, we’ll explore how R handles **dates**, **times**, and **logical states**. We'll use built-in functions like `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` along with formatting options to display time with precision. We’ll also touch on how to measure computation time and briefly introduce the `lubridate` package.

---

# 2. Date and Time Basics

## 2.1 Current System Date and Time

You can get the current **system date** and **date-time** using these commands:

```r
Sys.Date()
Sys.time()
```

### Displaying Higher Precision

To increase the precision of seconds displayed by `Sys.time()`, set the option `digits.secs`:

```r
op <- options(digits.secs = 6)
Sys.time()
options(op) # Reset to previous setting
```

---

## 2.2 Formatting Dates

You can format date-time output to match your local preferences or requirements:

```r
format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

This returns output like: `"Mon Jun 23 21:58:17 2025"` (format may vary based on locale).

---

# 3. Time Calculations

Both `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` return values that support arithmetic operations:

```r
start_time <- Sys.time()
Sys.sleep(2)  # pause for 2 seconds
end_time <- Sys.time()

duration <- end_time - start_time
duration  # Returns a 'difftime' object
```

This is useful for tracking how long certain computations or processes take.

---

# 4. System Time Visualization

If you’re including visuals in your report, insert plots or diagrams like so:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Systime.png")
```

---

# 5. Logical States in R

Logical values are essential in programming conditions:

- Use `TRUE` and `FALSE` (all caps).
- Shortcuts `T` and `F` are allowed, but it's safer to use the full forms.

```r
is_sunny <- TRUE
is_windy <- F  # Works, but not recommended
```

Logical values can be used in comparisons or arithmetic:

```r
as.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
# [1] 1 0 1
```

---

# 6. Preview of `lubridate`

For more powerful and flexible date-time manipulation, check out the **lubridate** package:

```r
library(lubridate)

ymd("2025-06-23")      # parse a string to a Date
now()                  # current date-time
today()                # current date only
```

`lubridate` makes date parsing, extraction (like year, month), and arithmetic simpler.

---

# Summary

- Use `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` to get the current date and time.
- Format time with `format()` for better readability.
- Perform arithmetic to calculate durations.
- Use logical values (`TRUE`, `FALSE`) consistently.
- For advanced date/time work, consider `lubridate`.
