For a large portfolio of insurance policies, losses follow a Pareto Type II distribution with shape parameter $\alpha=3.5$ and scale parameter $\theta=5000$. 

An insurance policy covers losses subject to an ordinary deductible of 500. Given that a loss has occurred, determine the average amount paid by the insurer.

```{r}
library(agop)
```

To determine the **average amount paid by the insurer** given a loss has occurred and the loss follows a Pareto Type II distribution with a deductible, we need to compute the **expected payment above the deductible**.

---

## üìò Problem Setup

- Losses \( X \sim \text{Pareto Type II}(\alpha = 3.5, \theta = 5000) \)
- Deductible: \( d = 500 \)
- We want:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[\text{Payment} \mid X > d] = \mathbb{E}[X - d \mid X > d]
  \]

This is the **mean excess loss** over the deductible, also known as the **conditional mean residual life**.

---

## üßÆ Step-by-Step Solution

For a Pareto Type II distribution, the conditional expectation is:

\[
\mathbb{E}[X - d \mid X > d] = \frac{\theta + d}{\alpha - 1} - d
\]

### Plug in the values:

- \( \alpha = 3.5 \)
- \( \theta = 5000 \)
- \( d = 500 \)

\[
\mathbb{E}[X - 500 \mid X > 500] = \frac{5000 + 500}{3.5 - 1} - 500 = \frac{5500}{2.5} - 500 = 2200 - 500 = 1700
\]

---

## ‚úÖ Final Answer

**The average amount paid by the insurer is \$1,700.**

---

## üîç Optional: R Code (for verification)

While the `agop` package is useful for actuarial functions, this specific calculation can be done directly:

```r
alpha <- 3.5
theta <- 5000
d <- 500

expected_payment <- ((theta + d) / (alpha - 1)) - d
expected_payment
# [1] 1700
```

Let me know if you'd like to visualize the distribution or explore how the deductible affects the expected payment!
