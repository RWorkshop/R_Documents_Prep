## Probability Distributions

### The Discrete Uniform Distribution

- Parameters: `min`, `max`.
- The default values are `0` and `1`.

### Variance and Covariance

```R
var(Mat1[,1])   # Determine the variance of the first column 
var(Mat1[,2])   # Determine the variance of the second column
var(Mat1[3,])   # Determine the variance of the third row
cov(Mat1[,1], Mat1[,2])  # Covariance of the first two columns
var(Mat1)  # Variance-covariance matrix of all columns
VCmat = var(Mat1)  # Save as matrix “VCmat”
cor(Mat1)  # Correlation matrix of all columns
cov2cor(VCmat)  # Convert a VC matrix to a correlation matrix
```

## Descriptive Statistics and Basic Graphical Methods

### Measures of Centrality and Dispersion

```R
# Anscombe’s Quartet
X1 = c(
Y1 =
```

## Logical and Relational Operators

- `||`  logical "Or"  (i.e. union)
- `&&`  logical "And" (i.e. intersection)

## Data Manipulation

### Types of Vectors

- Logical
- Numeric
- Character
- Others: Complex and Colour

### Creating a Vector

```R
scan()
X = c()
data.entry()
```

### Data Manipulation Functions

- `sort()`
- `rev()`
- `rep()`
- `length()`
- `order()`
