# The R Programming Language

The R Programming Language is a statistical and data analysis tool. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## Inputting Data

Concatenation.

## Using Help

```R
?mean

# Starting R the First Time

When running R from the computer lab, your M drive will be the working directory where your work will be saved by default. You can easily change to another directory at any time by selecting Change Dir... from the File menu. You can save your work at any time by selecting Save Workspace from the File menu. You will usually save the workspace in the working directory. When you quit R, you will be prompted to save your workspace.


## Creating Data with R

### Data Import

It is necessary to import outside data into R before you start analyzing it. Here we will look at some relevant issues.

#### Microsoft XLS File

Very often, the sample data is in MS Excelâ„¢ format and needs to be imported into R prior to use. For this, we can use the `read.xls()` function from the **gdata** package. The command reads from an Excel spreadsheet and returns a data frame. The following shows how to load an Excel spreadsheet named "mydata.xls". As the package is not in the core R library, it has to be installed and loaded into the R workspace. (This spreadsheet is saved in the working directory).

```R
library(gdata)                   # load the gdata package
help(read.xls)                   # documentation
mydata = read.xls("mydata.xls")  # read from first sheet
```
