\[\mbox{ Section 4 : Packages } \]


{Packages}


* A Package in ``R} is a file containing a collection of objects which have some common purpose.
* Packages enhance the capabilties and scope for research in a certain field. 
* For example, the
package MASS contains objects associated with the Venables and Ripleys ``\textit{Modern Applied
Statistics with S}‚Äù.

Some examples of packages are Actuar, written for actuarial science, and
QRMlib, which complements the Quantitative Risk Management The command library()
lists all the available packages. 

* To load a particular package, for example MASS, we would
write
\begin{framed}
``library(MASS)}

{Packages}

* The CRAN package repository features 6107 available packages. 
* Packages contain
various functions and data sets for numerous purposes, e.g.
\textbf{\textit{ggplot2}} package, \textbf{\textit{AER}} package, \textbf{\textit{survival}} package, etc.
* Some packages are part of the basic installation. Others can be
downloaded from CRAN.
* To access all of the functions and data sets in a particular package,
it must be loaded into the workspace. 
* For example, to load the
\textbf{\textit{ggplot2}} package:


\begin{framed}
``install.packages(ggplot2)}

``library(ggplot2)}
\end{framed}

{4.2 Using and Installing packages}

* Many packages come with R. To use them in an R session, you need to load the package, as
previously demonstrated.
* Some packages are not automatically installed when you install R but they need to be downloaded
and installed individually. 
* We must first install them using the install.packages()
function, which typically downloads the package from CRAN and installs it for use. (follow the
instructions as indicated).

{4.2.1 Version of R}
Many packages will require you to have the most recent version of R and also other packages.
It is a good idea to update regularly.
