### Basic R editing – Script Editor and ``edit()``
R has an inbuilt script editor. We will use it for this class, but there are plenty of top quality “Integrated Development Environments “ out there. 
  
(Read up about RStudio for  example.)

To start a new script, or open an existing script simply go to “File” on the menu bar and click the appropriate options.
A new dialogue box will appear. You can write and edit code using this editor.
To pass the code for compiling – press the “run line or selection” option (The third icon on the menu).
Another way to edit code is to use the ``edit()`` function – which operates directly from the command line.  
To edit the code defining an object X, simply type ``edit(X)``.

### {Changing GUI options}
We can change the GUI options using the “GUI preferences” option on the Edit menu. (Important when teaching R)
A demonstration will be done in class.
