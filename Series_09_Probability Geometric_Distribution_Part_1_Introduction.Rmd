# Geometric Distribution

## Introduction

- Geometric distributions model certain discrete random variables.
- Typically, a Geometric random variable represents the number of trials required to obtain the first **success**.
- Examples:
  - Number of tosses of a coin until the first "tail" is obtained.
  - Number of components tested until the first defective item is found.

---

## Geometric vs. Binomial

- A **Geometric** random variable is the number of trials until the first **success**.
- A **Binomial** random variable is the number of **successes** in \( n \) trials.

## Probability Distribution

A discrete random variable \( X \) is said to follow a Geometric distribution with parameter \( p \), written:

\[
X \sim \text{Geo}(p)
\]

The probability mass function (PMF) is:

\[
P(X = x) = (1 - p)^{x - 1} p, \quad x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\]

Where:
- \( p \) is the probability of success, with \( 0 < p < 1 \)

## Conditions for Geometric Trials

The trials must satisfy the following:

1. The total number of trials is potentially infinite.
2. Each trial has exactly two outcomes: success and failure.
3. The outcomes of all trials are statistically independent.
4. The probability of success is the same for each trial.

## Expected Value and Variance

For a geometric distribution:

\[
\mathrm{E}(X) = \frac{1}{p}
\]
\[
\mathrm{Var}(X) = \frac{1 - p}{p^2}
\]

## Relation to Binomial Distribution

- Both the Geometric and Binomial distributions are based on independent trials with constant success probability \( p \).
- **Geometric**: Number of trials until the first success.
- **Binomial**: Number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
