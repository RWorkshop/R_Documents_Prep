\textbf{Single Sample Proportion Test (a)}

*  In this procedure, we determine whether or not we are are justified in assuming that the population proportion takes a certain value.
*  For example, suppose we believed that the population proportion of students with iphones or androids was $80\%$.
*  We would write the null and alternative accordingly.
\[H_0 : \pi = 80\% \]
\[H_1 : \pi \neq 80\% \]
*  The  appropriate \texttt{R} command is \texttt{prop.test(x,n,p)}
*  $x$ is the number of successes, $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the population proportion assumed under the null hypothesis.
*  Suppose we survey 65 students, with 50 replying that they had an iphone or android.

<pre><code>
> prop.test(50,65,0.80)

1-sample proportions test

data:  50 out of 65, null probability 0.8
X-squared = 0.2163, df = 1, p-value = 0.6418

alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8
95 percent confidence interval:
0.6452269 0.8610191

sample estimates:
p
0.7692308
</code></pre>

---------------------------------------------------------------

*  The p-value is above the threshold. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the population proportion ($\pi$) is $80\%$.

*  The observed proportion is a very straightforward calculation:

\[ \hat{p} = \frac{50}{65} = 0.76923= 76.92\%\]
*  Nonetheless, you would be required to show how it was calculated.




\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test}
\begin{framed}

\textbf{H$_{0}$}: The sample is drawn from a normally distributed population.\\ \smallskip
\textbf{H$_{1}$}: The sample is drawn from a population that is NOT normally distributed

\end{framed}


*  Compare the p-value to some pre-defined thrreshold.
*  We will use a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.
*  This test is a one-tailed test. We compare the p-value from the Shapiro Wilk Test to 0.05.
*  In the case of two-tailed tests, we would compare the p-value to 0.025, i.e. ($\alpha/2$).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------%

\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test}


*  If the p-value is less than the threshold, we reject the null hypothesis.\\
\textit{(We have enough evidence to say that the population is not normally distributed.)}

\smallskip
*  If the p-value is greater than the threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \\ \textit{(We dont have enough evidence to say that the population is not normally distributed.)}
\smallskip

*  Type I and Type II Errors apply to this test, just like any other test.
