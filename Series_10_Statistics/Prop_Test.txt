\textbf{Single Sample Proportion Test (a)}

*  In this procedure, we determine whether or not we are are justified in assuming that the population proportion takes a certain value.
*  For example, suppose we believed that the population proportion of students with iphones or androids was $80\%$.
*  We would write the null and alternative accordingly.
\[H_0 : \pi = 80\% \]
\[H_1 : \pi \neq 80\% \]
*  The  appropriate \texttt{R} command is \texttt{prop.test(x,n,p)}
*  $x$ is the number of successes, $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the population proportion assumed under the null hypothesis.
*  Suppose we survey 65 students, with 50 replying that they had an iphone or android.

\textbf{Single Sample Proportion Test (b)}
<pre><code>
> prop.test(50,65,0.80)

1-sample proportions test

data:  50 out of 65, null probability 0.8
X-squared = 0.2163, df = 1, p-value = 0.6418

alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8
95 percent confidence interval:
0.6452269 0.8610191

sample estimates:
p
0.7692308
</code></pre>


%==========================================================%



\textbf{Single Sample Proportion Test (c)}


*  The p-value is above the threshold. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the population proportion ($\pi$) is $80\%$.

*  The observed proportion is a very straightforward calculation:

\[ \hat{p} = \frac{50}{65} = 0.76923= 76.92\%\]
*  Nonetheless, you would be required to show how it was calculated.




\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test}
\begin{framed}

\textbf{H$_{0}$}: The sample is drawn from a normally distributed population.\\ \smallskip
\textbf{H$_{1}$}: The sample is drawn from a population that is NOT normally distributed

\end{framed}


*  Compare the p-value to some pre-defined thrreshold.
*  We will use a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.
*  This test is a one-tailed test. We compare the p-value from the Shapiro Wilk Test to 0.05.
*  In the case of two-tailed tests, we would compare the p-value to 0.025, i.e. ($\alpha/2$).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------%

\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test}


*  If the p-value is less than the threshold, we reject the null hypothesis.\\
\textit{(We have enough evidence to say that the population is not normally distributed.)}

\smallskip
*  If the p-value is greater than the threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \\ \textit{(We dont have enough evidence to say that the population is not normally distributed.)}
\smallskip

*  Type I and Type II Errors apply to this test, just like any other test.

\subsection{Grubbs Test for Determining an Outlier}

The Grubbs test is used to determine if there are any outliers in a data set.\\ \bigskip
There is no agreed formal definition for an outlier. The definition of outlier used for this procedure is a value that unusually distance from the rest of the values.\\  (For the sake of clarity , we shall call this type of outlier a \textbf{Grubbs Outlier}).\\ Consider the following data set: is the lowest value 4.01 an outlier?

<pre><code>
6.98 8.49 7.97 6.64
8.80 8.48 5.94 6.94
6.89 7.47 7.32 4.01
</code></pre>

Under the null hypothesis, there are no outliers present in the data set. 
We reject this hypothesis if the p-value is sufficiently small.\\
(Remark: This is a one-tailed test).

\subsection{Grubbs Test for Determining an Outlier}
\begin{framed}
<pre><code>
> grubbs.test(x, two.sided=T)
Grubbs test for one outlier
data: x
G = 2.4093, U = 0.4243, p-value = 0.05069
alternative hypothesis: lowest value 4.01 is an outlier
</code></pre>
\end{framed}
We dont not have enough evidence to class 4.01 as an outlier.
We conclude that while small by comparison to the other values, the lowest value 4.01 is not an outlier.

\subsection{Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (a)}
The null hypothesis is that two populations have the same proportions for a particular characteristic.
\[H_0 : \pi_1 = \pi_2 \]
\[H_1 : \pi_1 \neq \pi_2 \]

*  The command is \texttt{prop.test(c(x1,x2),c(n1,n2))}
*  $x1$ and $x2$ are the number of successes from both samples.
*  $n2$ and $n2$ are the sample sizes for both groups.
*  The difference in population proportions assumed under the null hypothesis is zero.
*  (It is possible to specify a different null value, but we will not consider this in this module.)


<p>

\subsection{Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (b)}

*  Consider a study where the proportion of Irish students who owned mobile devices, such as iphones and androids was compared to the corresponding proportion of French student.
*  As before, $65$ Irish students were interviewed, with $50$ replying that they owned mobile devices.
*  $90$ french students were interview, with 60 responding that they owned mobile devices.
*  The test of equality of proportions is implemented on the next slide.


<p>



\subsection{Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (c)}
Based on the p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to assume a difference in proportions. Also the expected difference assumed under the null hypothesis, i.e. 0, is contained in the confidence interval.
<pre><code>
> prop.test(c(50,60),c(65,90))

2-sample test for equality of proportions

data:  c(50, 60) out of c(65, 90)
X-squared = 1.4613, df = 1, p-value = 0.2267
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95 percent confidence interval:
-0.05202058  0.25714878
sample estimates:
prop 1    prop 2
0.7692308 0.6666667
</code></pre>


\subsection{Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (d)}

*  You would be required to compute the differences in observed proportions.
*  Additionally you will given the \texttt{R} code for one sample procedures. This may or may not be relevant for answering the question.
<pre><code>
> prop.test(60,90,0.80)
...
...
X-squared = 9.184, df = 1, p-value = 0.002441
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.8
