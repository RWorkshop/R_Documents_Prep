OO Programming Commands
=================================
A generic function is a function that identifies the class of its input and calls an appropriate method.
Help files are very useful with questions 9 and 10

- The **getMethod()** function is used to obtain the function body for an S4 method function. A call to getMethod() returns the method for a particular function and signature.
- The **getClass()** function gets the definition for a class.
- The **showMethods()** function shows a summary of the methods for one or more generic functions, possibly restricted to those involving specified classes.
- The **getS3Method()** function is used to obtain the function body for an S3 method function.
- The **getOldMethod()** function registers an old-style (a.k.a. ‘S3’) class as a formally defined class. Each of the names will be defined as an S4 class.
