### Squared Euclidean distance 

The Squared Euclidean distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sum^{k}_{j=1} ( x_j - y_j)^2  \]
The Squared Euclidean distance may be preferred to the Euclidean distance as it is slightly less computational complex, without loss of any information.

----------------------------------------------------

### Worked Example 

Let us consider measuring the distances between between two points using
the three continuous variables pollution, depth and temperature. Let us suppose that a difference of 4.1 in terms of pollution is considered quite large and unusual, while a difference of 48 in terms of depth is large, but not particularly unusual.
What would happen if we applied the Euclidean distance formula to measure distance between two cases.
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
Variables & case 1 & case 2 \\ \hline 
Pollution & 6.0 & 1.9 \\
Depth & 51 & 99 \\
Temp & 3.0 & 2.9 \\
  \hline
\end{array}$$

Here is the calculation for Euclidean Distance:
\[ d = \sqrt{(6.0 - 1.9)^2 + (51 - 99)^2 + (3.0 - 2.9)^2}   \]
 \[ d = \sqrt{16.81 + 2304 + 0.01} = \sqrt{2320.82} = 48.17 \]

The contribution of the second variable depth to this calculation is huge - one could say that the distance is practically just the absolute difference in the depth values (equal to
$|51-99| = 48$) with only tiny additional contributions from pollution and temperature. These three variables are on
completely different scales of measurement and the larger depth values have larger differences, so they will dominate in the calculation of Euclidean distances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Standardization

The approach to take here is ***standardization***, which is is necessary to balance out the contributions, and the
conventional way to do this is to transform the variables so they all have the same variance
of 1. At the same time we ***center*** the variables at their means - this centering is not
necessary for calculating distance, but it makes the variables all have mean zero and thus
easier to compare. 

The transformation commonly called standardization is thus as follows:

\[\mbox{standardized value} = \frac{\mbox{observed value - mean}}{ \mbox{standard deviation}}\]

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
Variables & Case 1 & Case 2 & Mean & Std. Dev & Case 1 (std) & Case 2 (std) \\ \hline
Pollution & 6.0 & 1.9 & 4.517	&	2.141	&	0.693	&	-1.222	\\
Depth & 51 & 99 & 74.433	&	15.615	&	-1.501	&	1.573	\\
Temp & 3.0 & 2.9 & 3.057	&	0.281	&	-0.201	&	-0.557	\\
  \hline
\end{array}$$


\[ d_{std} =  \sqrt{(0.693 - (- 1.222))^2 + (-1.501-1.573)^2 + (-0.201-(-0.557))^2} \]

\[ d_{std} = \sqrt{3.667 + 9.449 + 0.127} = \sqrt{13.243} = 3.639 \]

Pollution and temperature have higher contributions than before but depth still plays the
largest role in this particular example, even after standardization. But this contribution is
justified now, since it does show the biggest standardized difference between the samples.

## Manhattan (City Block) Distance

The City block distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
$$ \sum^{k}_{j=1} | x_j - y_j |  $$

The City block distance is always greater than or equal to zero. The measurement would be zero for identical points and high for points that show little similarity.

#### Example

* Compute the Manhattan Distance between the following points: $X = \{1,3,4,2\}$ and $Y = \{5,2,5,2\}$


$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
$x_j$&$y_j$&   $x_j - y_j$&$| x_j - y_j |$\\ \hline
1&5&-4&4\\
3&2&1&1\\
4&5&-1&1\\
2&2&0&0\\ \hline
& & & 6 \\
  \hline
\end{array}$$

* The Manhattan Distance between the two points is 6.

### Cluster Analysis : Proximity Matrices

Using ***nearest neighbour*** linkage, describe how the agglomeration schedule based on the following 
proximity matrix. With nearest neighbour, a case is assigned to the cluster of the case with which it has the shortest distance. Cluster are also joined on this basis.
