Splitting the Data
=======================

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
```

We can see the number of monitors in our training, testing, and original data by typing in the name of our split object. 
The result will look like this: <training data sample number, testing data sample number, original sample number>

Importantly the initial_split() function only determines what rows of our pm data frame should be assigned for training or testing, it does not actually split the data.

To extract the testing and training data we can use the training() and testing() functions also of the rsample package.

```{r}
train_pm <-rsample::training(pm_split)
test_pm <-rsample::testing(pm_split)
```
