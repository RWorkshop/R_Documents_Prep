### {Section 3 Inspecting a Data Set}

### Summary of useful commands}
 
*  texttt{dim()} and texttt{length()}
*  texttt{nrow()} and texttt{ncol()}
*  texttt{names()}
*  texttt{summary()}
*  texttt{tail()}
*  texttt{head()}
*  texttt{describe()} (from the textbf{psych} package)
 

 
### {3.1 Dimensions of a data set}
 
*  We have remarked that some data sets are very large. 
*  This is perhaps a good place to consider
 summary information about data objects. 
*  For a simple vector, a useful command to determine
 the length (remark: sample size) is the function texttt{length()}.
 
 <pre>
 texttt{Y=4:18}
 texttt{length(Y)}
 
 </pre>
<p>
 For more complex data sets ( and data frames which we will see later) , we have several
 tools for assessing the size of data.
 
<p>


### {Column (Variable) names and Row names}
 
*  We can also determine the row names and column names using the functions texttt{rownames()}
 and texttt{colnames()}. 
*  If there are no specific row or column names, the command will just return
 the indices.
