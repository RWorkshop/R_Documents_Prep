Central Limit Theorem

Hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction are based on the Central Limit Theorem

Recall the Dice experiment in previous weeks.

Dice1=floor(runif(50,min=1,max=7))  


A simple demonstration of the central limit theorem is given by the problem of rolling a large number of dice repeatedly. The distribution of the sum (or average) of the rolled numbers will be well approximated by a normal distribution, the parameters of which can be determined empirically.
 
N=1000                              #number of loops
Avgs=numeric(N)              #array “Avgs” store the sample means
for( i in 1:N)
              { Dice=floor(runif(50,min=1,max=7))  ;Avgs[i]=mean(Dice)  }                                 
Avgs                                     #print Avgs dataset to screen
Lets look at the distribution of the means. Are they normally distributed?

mean(Avgs)        #compute the mean. 
qqnorm(Avgs)        #draws a QQ plot that is used to check for normality.
qqline(Avgs)           #adds trend line to QQplot.
shapiro.test(Avgs)      #Shapiro Wilk test.
