### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a foundational concept in statistics. It states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution—regardless of the original distribution of the data.

This principle underpins many statistical methods, including:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence interval construction

### Simulating Dice Rolls in R

Let’s explore the CLT using a simple simulation: rolling a fair six-sided die.

You can simulate a single die roll using either of the following R commands:

```r
Dice1 <- floor(runif(50, min = 1, max = 7))  # Uniform random integers from 1 to 6
Dice2 <- sample(1:6, 1, replace = TRUE)      # Random sample from 1 to 6
```

### Demonstrating the CLT with Dice Averages

To demonstrate the CLT, we’ll simulate rolling 50 dice, compute the average, and repeat this process 100 times. The resulting distribution of sample means should approximate a normal distribution.

```r
N <- 100  # Number of simulations
myDiceSums <- numeric(N)  # Store sample means

for (i in 1:N) {
  Dice <- floor(runif(50, min = 1, max = 7))  # Simulate 50 dice rolls
  myDiceSums[i] <- mean(Dice)                # Store the mean
}

myDiceSums  # View the sample means
```

### Analyzing the Distribution of Sample Means

Let’s assess whether the sample means are normally distributed:

```r
mean(myDiceSums)         # Compute the overall mean
qqnorm(myDiceSums)       # Generate a Q-Q plot
qqline(myDiceSums)       # Add a reference line to the Q-Q plot
shapiro.test(myDiceSums) # Perform the Shapiro-Wilk normality test
```

- The **Q-Q plot** visually compares the distribution of sample means to a normal distribution.
- The **Shapiro-Wilk test** provides a formal test for normality.

If the points in the Q-Q plot fall roughly along the line and the Shapiro-Wilk test returns a high p-value (typically > 0.05), we have evidence that the sample means are approximately normally distributed—just as the CLT predicts.
