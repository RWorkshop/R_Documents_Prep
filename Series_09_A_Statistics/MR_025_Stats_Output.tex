The data set X and Y are both assumed to be normally distributed. A graphical procedure was carried out to assess whether or not this assumption of normality is valid for data set Y. Consider the Q-Q plot in the figure below.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
*  Provide a brief description on how to interpret this plot.
*  What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}

The standard deviations of data sets X and Y are given in the R code below. 
An inference procedure was carried out to assess whether or not X and Y can be assumed to have equal variance.
The standard deviation of X is 3.11.The standard deviation of Y is 1.89

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
*  Formally state the null and alternative hypothesis.
*  The test statistic has been omitted from the R code output. Compute the value of the test statistic.
*  What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your answer.
*  Explain how a conclusion for this procedure can be based on the 95\% confidence interval.
