3. The data below give the daily numbers of homicides in London for the 1095 days from 
1 April 2004 to 31 March 2007.

(i) Calculate, to 4 decimal places, the mean number of homicides per day.
(2)
(ii) If homicides are assumed to happen as random events, then the daily numbers 
of homicides should follow a Poisson distribution. Under the hypothesis that 
the data are a random sample from a Poisson distribution, calculate the 
expected frequencies that correspond to the observed frequencies in the table 
above.
(6)
(iii) Carry out a formal test at the 5% significance level to investigate whether or 
not homicides occurred as random events.
(8)
(iv) For a random sample of 139 homicides where the method of killing was 
known, 29 of the homicides were by shooting. Find a 95% confidence interval 
for the underlying population proportion of homicides that are by shooting.
