The claim severity for a line of property liability insurance is modeled as a mixture of two Pareto Type II distributions with the first distribution having $\alpha=1$ and $\lambda=2500$ and the second distribution having $\alpha=2$ and $\lambda=1250$. These two distributions have equal weights. 


Determine the limited expected value of claim severity at claim size 1000.

---

* set the seed to 1234
* These two distributions have equal weights, so lets simulate 30000 (thirty thousand) variates for each.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
```
