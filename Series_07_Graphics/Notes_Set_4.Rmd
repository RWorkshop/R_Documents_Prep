### Graphics in R

The standard procedure in R to make 1D and 2D plots is plot. Histogram are available
through hist. These commands can be supplied with options to allow for titles, subtitles,
and labels on the x-axes:
plot(data,main=‘‘Title’’,sub=‘‘Subtitle’’,xlab=‘‘X-axis’’,ylab=‘‘Y-axis’’)

Quantile-quantile plots are available through qqplot, while qqnorm yields a plot of the quantiles
of a data set against the quantiles of a fitted normal distribution (normal probability plot).

A Box-and-Whisker plot is also available for exploratory data analysis through boxplot (if
the data set is a data frame like produced by read.table, then multiple Box-and-Whisker
plots are produced). The empirical cumulative distribution function is available through ecdf.
Graphics can be saved to files by choosing File and Save as in the menu of the R console.
