A dice is thrown 5 times. Calculate the probability of

i.
Obtaining exactly one six


ii)    Obtaining at least one six
bi.
Calculate the (theoretical) mean and variance of the number of sixes obtained?



P(x=k)=nkpk(1-p)n-k






Part 1 


P(x=1)=51(16)1(56)4


\[ \choose{5,1}= \frac{5!1!}{4!}= 5\]


P(x=1)= 5(16)1(56)4= 0.401 


%================================================================================%


Part 2


obtaining at least one head is complement of obtaining zero heads


P(x1)= 1 - p(x=0)



P(x=0)=50(16)0(56)5


50=5!0!5!= 1


P(x1)= 1- 0.401 =0.599 



\begin{enumerate}
\item During the day, cars pass along a point on a remote road at an average rate of one per 20 minutes. Calculate the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The time between the arrival of 2 cars is greater than 1 hour.
\item The time between the arrival of 2 cars is less than 10 minutes 
\itemThe time between the arrival of 2 cars is greater than 20 minutes, but less than 40 minutes. 

\end{enumerate}



\subsection*{Question 5}
Let $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=10,\sigma=2)$. Calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} $\Pr(X>10)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X<3)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X>8.4)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(6<X<14)$. 
 \item  The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.3. 
 \item  The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.8.



\subsection*{Question 6}
Assume that speeds of cars on a motorway have a normal distribution with mean 115km/hr and standard deviation 4km/hr.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} Draw a rough sketch of the distribution. 
 \item  $\Pr(X>120)=$ ? 
 \item  $\Pr(X<100)=$ ? 
 \item  $\Pr(100<X<110)=$ ? 
 \item  1\% of drivers travel above what speed?

%% Repeat 2005 (question 2)(b)	
The compressive strength of concrete for fresh-water exhibition tanks has mean 5000 psi and standard deviation 240 psi. Assuming that the compressive strength is normally distributed, calculate the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi.
