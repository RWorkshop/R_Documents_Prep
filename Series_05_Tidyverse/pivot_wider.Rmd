6.11 pivot_longer()
For our goal with this data set, we do not need to switch back to a longer data format, however reshaping your data to a longer format may be something you want to do one day.

Letâ€™s try to reshape the data_wide back to a long format that we originally started with.

When you have multiple value columns this is not as intuitive as pivot_wider(). To see more documentation and examples use ?tidyr::pivot_longer().

data_long <- pivot_longer(data_wide,
                          contains("mean"),
                          names_to = c(".value", "Condition"),
                          names_sep = "_")
