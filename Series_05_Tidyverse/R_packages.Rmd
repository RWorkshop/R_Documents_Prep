Packages
===============
### Using and Installing packages
Many packages come with R. To use them in an R session, you need to load the package. 
For example to load the MASS package which contains functions and datasets that accompany Venables and Ripley, Modern Applied Statistics with S, you use the command:

### Installing additional packages
Some packages are not automatically installed when you install R but they need to be downloaded and installed individually. 
An important example is the 'evd' package that accompanies Fox, Applied Regression. 

Working with R Pacakges
====================================


*  Type `library()` onto the command line to find out what packages were installed on your computer
when you put in `R`. 
*  Now type `search()` to get a list of the packages from that list that are
already loaded in (installed packages are not necessarily loaded in). 


Installing R Pacakges
====================================

<pre><code>
install.package("packagename")
download.package("packagename")
</code></pre>
----------------------------------
	
<h5> Base packages </h5>
Base packages are considered part of the R source code. These packages contain the basic functions that allow <code>R</code> to 
work, and include many commonly used datasets and standard statistical and graphical functions. They should be automatically 
available in any <code>R</code> installation.
To see which packages are installed on your computer, use the <code>library()</code> command, with no arguments.
 
<h5> Contributed packages </h5>
Hundreds of contributed packages covering a wide array of modern statistical methods are available from the 
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; http: //cran.r-project.org).
 
 To access all of the functions and data sets in a particular package, it must be loaded into the workspace. 
 For example, to load the lattice package:
 <pre><code>
 > library(lattice) 
 </code></pre>
 
 To remove a package from a session, use the detach command
 >detach(package:lattice)
 
 Packages must be reloaded at the start of each new session.
 
 
<pre><code>
 library(MASS)							  #loads the MASS package
 
 install.packages("evir")			#install the "evir" package (select the Irish CRAN Mirror)
 library(evir)
</code></pre>

 
<h5>Packages</h5>

Type \texttt{library()} onto the command line to find out what packages were installed on your computer
when you put in <tt>R</tt>. Now type <code>search()</code> to get a list of the packages from that list that are
already loaded in (installed packages are not necessarily loaded in). 

<h5>Packages</h5>

<pre><code>
install.package("packagename")
download.package("packagename")
</code></pre>

### Packages 
 
*  A Package in <tt>R</tt> is a file containing a collection of objects which have some common purpose.
*  Packages enhance the capabilties and scope for research in a certain field. 
*  For example, the
 package MASS contains objects associated with the Venables and Ripleys ``\textit{Modern Applied
 Statistics with S}”.

 *  ``10 R packages I wish I knew about earlier" - Drew Conway (Yhat.com, February 2013)
<p> *  ``The HadleyVerse" - Hadley Wickham
 
 
 *   ggplot2, dplyr, reshape, lubridate, stringr
 
 *   With Romain Francois, Dianne Cook and Garret Grolemund.

### R Packages
 
Some examples of packages are Actuar, written for actuarial science, and QRMlib, which complements the Quantitative Risk Management The command library()
 lists all the available packages. 
 
 To load a particular package, for example MASS, we would
 write
 library(MASS)

### Packages
 
 *  The CRAN package repository features 6107 available packages. 
 *  Packages contain
 various functions and data sets for numerous purposes, e.g. {ggplot2} package, {AER} package, {survival} package, etc.
 *  Some packages are part of the basic installation. Others can be downloaded from CRAN.
 *  To access all of the functions and data sets in a particular package, it must be loaded into the workspace. 
 *  For example, to load the {ggplot2} package:


<pre><code>
 install.packages(ggplot2)
 library(ggplot2)
 </code></pre>
 
 
<p>
 
### Using and Installing packages
 
 *  Many packages come with R. To use them in an R session, you need to load the package, as
 previously demonstrated.
 *  Some packages are not automatically installed when you install R but they need to be downloaded
 and installed individually. 
 *  We must first install them using the install.packages()
 function, which typically downloads the package from CRAN and installs it for use. (follow the
 instructions as indicated).
