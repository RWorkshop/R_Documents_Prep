### Partitioning Data
First, we split the data into two groups: a ***training set*** and a ***test set***. 

To do this, the `createDataPartition()` function is used.

#### Data Splitting

* Simple Splitting Based on the Outcome
* Splitting Based on the Predictors
* Data Splitting for Time Series



```{r}
# Data splitting with createDataPartition()
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=iris$Species, p=0.75, list=FALSE)

training <- iris[inTrain, ]
testing <- iris[-inTrain, ]

```




```{r}
dim(training)
```


```{r}
dim(testing)
```
