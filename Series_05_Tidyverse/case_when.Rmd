6.7 case_when()
Often times you will want to mutate() values conditionally based on values in other columns. There are two functions that will help you do this, ifelse() and case_when(). ifelse() is a base R function and case_when() is a dplyr function.

ifelse() takes the format: ifelse(conditional argument, value if TRUE, value if FALSE)

As an example, lets say we want to code a new variable that indicates whether the reaction time on a trial met a certain response deadline or not. Let’s call this column Met_ResponseDeadline and give a value of 1 to trials that met the deadline and 0 to trials that did not meet the deadline. Let’s set the response deadline at a reaction time of 500 milliseconds.

The conditional argument will take the form: RT is less than or equal to 500. If this statement is TRUE, then we will assign a value of 1 to the column Met_ResponseDeadline. If this statement is FALSE, then we will assign a value of 0 to the column Met_ResponseDeadline.

The code looks like:

data <- import %>%
  mutate(Met_ResponseDeadline = ifelse(RT <= 500, 1, 0))
Check out data to make sure it worked.

You can even combine multiple ifelse() statements into one. Let’s say we actually want to recode the column ACC to reflect not just correct and incorrect response but also whether they met the response deadline or not. That is, a value of 1 will represent responses that were correct AND met the response deadline and values of 0 represent responses that were either incorrect, did not meet the response deadline, or both.

data <- import %>%
  mutate(ACC = ifelse(ACC == 1, ifelse(RT <= 500, 1, 0), 0))
The arguments for the first ifelse() are as follows: Accuracy is equal to 1. If TRUE, then second ifelse() statement. If FALSE, then 0.

This makes sense because if the accuracy is 0 (incorrect), then the value needs to remain 0. However, if the accuracy is 1, the value will depend on whether the reaction time is less than 500 (thus the second ifelse()).

If accuracy is equal to 1, then if reaction time is less than or equal to 500, then set accuracy to 1. If FALSE, then set accuracy to 0.

Know that you can place the additional ifelse() statement in either the TRUE or FALSE argument and can keep iterating on ifelse() statements for as long as you need (however that can get pretty complicated).

case_when() is an alternative to an ifelse(). Anytime you need multiple ifelse() statements case_when() tends to simplify the code and logic involved.

Let’s see examples of the two examples provided for ifelse() as a comparison.

data <- import %>%
  mutate(Met_ResponseDeadline = case_when(RT <= 500 ~ 1,
                                          RT > 500 ~ 0))
Notice that the notation is quite different here. Each argument contains the format: conditional statement followed by the symbol ~ (this should be read as “then set as”) and then a value to be assigned when the conditional statement is TRUE. There is no value to specify when it is FALSE.

Therefore, it is important when using the case_when() function to either 1) include enough TRUE statement arguments to cover ALL possible values or 2) use the uncharacteristically non-intuitive notation - TRUE ~ "some value". In the example above, all possible RT values are included in the two arguments RT <= 500 and RT > 500.

To provide an example of the second option:

data <- import %>%
  mutate(Met_ResponseDeadline = case_when(RT <= 500 ~ 1,
                                          TRUE ~ 0))
The case_when() function will evaluate each argument in sequential order. So when it gets to the last argument (and this should always be the last argument), this is basically saying, when it is TRUE that none of the above arguments were TRUE (hence why this argument is being evaluated) then (~) set the value to “some value” (whatever value you want to specify).

Now this function gets a little more complicated if you want to set values to NA. NA values are technically logical values like TRUE or FALSE. The values in a column can only be of one type; numerical, character, logical, etc. Therefore, if you have numerical values in a column but want to set some to NA, then this becomes an issue when using case_when() (hopefully this will be fixed in future updates to dplyr). For now, how to get around this is changing the type of value that NA is. For instance; as.numeric(NA), as.character(NA).

data <- import %>%
  mutate(Met_ResponseDeadline = case_when(RT <= 500 ~ 1,
                                          RT > 500 ~ 0,
                                          TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)))
Now on to the example in which we used two ifelse() statements.

data <- import %>%
  mutate(ACC = case_when(ACC == 1 & RT <= 500 ~ 1,
                         ACC == 1 & RT > 500 ~ 0,
                         ACC == 0 ~ 0))
When you have multiple ifelse() statements case_when() becomes easier to read. Compare this use of case_when() with the equivalent ifelse() above.

The case_when() function makes it very explicit what is happening. There are three conditional statements, therefore three categories of responses.

A correct response and reaction time that meets the deadline.

A correct response and reaction time that DOES NOT meet the deadline.

An incorrect response

These three options cover all possible combinations between the the two columns ACC and RT.

Accuracy should only be set to 1 (correct) with the first option and that is made quite clearly because it is the only one with ~ 1.

This is not as obvious in the ifelse() example.

Let’s move on to the next dplyr function.
