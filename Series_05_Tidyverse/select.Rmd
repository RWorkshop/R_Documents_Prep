6.5 select()
select() allows you to select which columns to keep and/or remove.

Let’s keep Subject, Condition, RT, Trial, and Accuracy and remove TrialProc, TargetArrowDirection, SessionDate, and SessionTime.

select() is actually quite versatile - you can remove columns by specifying certain patterns. I will only cover a couple here, but to learn more Visit the select() webpage

We could just simply select all the columns we want to keep

data <- select(data, Subject, Condition, RT, Trial, Accuracy)
alternatively we can specify which columns we want to remove by placing a - in front of the columns

data <- select(data, -TrialProc, -TargetArrowDirection, 
               -SessionDate, -SessionTime)
or we can remove (or keep) columns based on a pattern. For instance SessionDate and SessionTime both start with Session

data <- select(data, -TrialProc, -TargetArrowDirection, 
               -starts_with("Session"))
You might start realizing that there is always more than one way to perform the same operation. It is good to be aware of all the ways you can use a function because there might be certain scenarios where it is better or even required to use one method over another. In this example, you only need to know the most straightforward method of simply selecting which columns to keep.

You can also rename variables as you select() them… let’s change Accuracy back to ACC… just because we are crazy!

data <- select(data, Subject, Condition, RT, Trial, ACC = Accuracy)
We are keeping Subject, Condition, RT, Trial, and renaming ACC to Accuracy.
