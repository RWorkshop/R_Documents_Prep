# dplyr: Grammar of Data Manipulation

## Prerequisites

Before working with `dplyr`, you should be familiar with:

- Installing and loading R packages
- Understanding what a data frame is
- The principles of tidy data

---

## Introduction to dplyr

`dplyr` is a package authored by Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois. It is designed to make data manipulation in R more intuitive and efficient.

- Focuses on data frames (hence the "d" in `dplyr`)
- Successor to the `plyr` package
- Offers a consistent and user-friendly API
- Written in C++ for high performance

## Key Ideas Behind dplyr (Hadley Wickham)

1. **Performance**  
   Core functions are written in C++ (via Rcpp) for speed. Future improvements will leverage multi-core processing.

2. **Unified Interface**  
   The same functions work on local data frames and remote database tables (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, BigQuery).

3. **Simplicity**  
   Each function does one thing well. Common operations include:
   - `group_by()`
   - `summarise()`
   - `mutate()`
   - `filter()`
   - `select()`
   - `arrange()`

## Goals of dplyr

- Identify the most essential data manipulation tools and make them easy to use
- Provide fast performance for in-memory data
- Offer a consistent interface across data sources (data frames, data tables, databases)

## Installing dplyr and Example Datasets

Install the package and supporting datasets:

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "Lahman"))

library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Tidy Data Principles

To use `dplyr` effectively, your data should follow the principles of tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column  
2. Each observation forms a row  
3. Each table/file stores data about one kind of observation

## Key Data Structures in dplyr

The primary object in `dplyr` is a `tbl`, a tabular data structure. Supported backends include:

- **Data frames** (most common)
- **Data tables** (optimized for large datasets)
- **Databases**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redshift, MySQL/MariaDB, BigQuery, MonetDB
- **Arrays** (partial support for data cubes)

> For this workshop, we will focus on data frames.

## `order_by()` Helper Function

`order_by()` is used to control the order of window function output.

### Description

This function is useful when applying window functions in R that lack a built-in ordering parameter. When translated to SQL, it modifies the `ORDER BY` clause of the `OVER()` function.
