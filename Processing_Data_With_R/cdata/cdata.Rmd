cdata: Fluid Data Transformations.

#### Description 

Supplies implementations of higher order "fluid data" transforms. These’ transforms move data be-
tween rows and columns, are controlled by a graphical transformation specification, and have pivot
and un-pivot as special cases. Large scale implementation is based on ’DBI’, so should be usable
on ’DBI’ compliant data sources (include large systems such as ’PostgreSQL’ and ’Spark’). Conve-
nience adapters are provided for in-memory ’data.frame’s. A theory of fluid data transforms can be
found in the following articles: http://winvector.github.io/FluidData/FluidDataReshapingWithCdata.
