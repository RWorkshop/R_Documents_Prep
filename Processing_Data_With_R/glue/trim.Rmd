## trim Trim a character vector

#### Description
This trims a character vector according to the trimming rules used by glue. These follow similar
rules to Python Docstrings, with the following features.
• Leading and trailing whitespace from the first and last lines is removed.
• A uniform amount of indentation is stripped from the second line on, equal to the minimum
indentation of all non-blank lines after the first.
• Lines can be continued across newlines by using \.

trim(x)
</code></pre>
Arguments
