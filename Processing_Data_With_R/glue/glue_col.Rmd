knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(glue)
```



##### Description
The crayon package defines a number of functions used to color terminal output. glue_col() and
``glue_data_col()`` functions provide additional syntax to make using these functions in glue strings
easier.
Using the following syntax will apply the function blue function to the text "foo bar".
{blue foo bar}
If you want an expression to be evaluated, simply place that in a normal brace expression (these can
be nested).
{blue 1 + 1 = {1 + 1}}

#### Usage

<pre><code>
glue_col(..., .envir = parent.frame(), .na = "NA")
glue_data_col(.x, ..., .envir = parent.frame(), .na = "NA")
</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* ... [expressions]
Expressions string(s) to format, multiple inputs are concatenated together before
formatting.
glue_collapse 5
* .envir [environment: parent.frame()]
Environment to evaluate each expression in. Expressions are evaluated from left
to right. If .x is an environment, the expressions are evaluated in that environment
and .envir is ignored.
.na [character(1): ‘NA’]
Value to replace NA values with. If NULL missing values are propagated, that is
an NA result will cause NA output. Otherwise the value is replaced by the value
of .na.
.x [listish]
An environment, list or data frame used to lookup values.

#### Examples
```{r}
if (require(crayon)) {
glue_col("{blue foo bar}")
glue_col("{blue 1 + 1 = {1 + 1}}")
white_on_grey <- bgBlack $ white
glue_col("{white_on_grey
Roses are {red {colors()[[552]]}}
Violets are {blue {colors()[[26]]}}
`glue_col()` can show {red c}{yellow o}{green l}{cyan o}{blue r}{magenta s}
and {bold bold} and {underline underline} too!
}")
}
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
