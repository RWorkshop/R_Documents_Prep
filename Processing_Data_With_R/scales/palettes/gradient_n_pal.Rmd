#### Description
Arbitrary colour gradient palette (continuous).

#### Usage
<pre><code>
gradient_n_pal(colours, values = NULL, space = "Lab")
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``colours``: vector of colours
* ``values``: if colours should not be evenly positioned along the gradient this vector gives
the position (between 0 and 1) for each colour in the colours vector. See
``rescale()`` for a convenience function to map an arbitrary range to between
0 and 1.
* ``space``: colour space in which to calculate gradient. Must be "Lab" - other values are
deprecated.
