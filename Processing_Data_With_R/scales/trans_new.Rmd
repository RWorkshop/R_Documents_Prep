trans_new Create a new transformation object.
#### Description
A transformation encapsulates a transformation and its inverse, as well as the information needed
to create pleasing breaks and labels. The breaks function is applied on the transformed range of the
range, and itâ€™s expected that the labels function will perform some kind of inverse transformation
on these breaks to give them labels that are meaningful on the original scale.
#### Usage
trans_new(name, transform, inverse, breaks = extended_breaks(),
minor_breaks = regular_minor_breaks(), format = format_format(),
domain = c(-Inf, Inf))
trans_range 45
#### Arguments
name transformation name
transform function, or name of function, that performs the transformation
inverse function, or name of function, that performs the inverse of the transformation
breaks default breaks function for this transformation. The breaks function is applied
to the raw data.
minor_breaks default minor breaks function for this transformation.
format default format for this transformation. The format is applied to breaks generated
to the raw data.
domain domain, as numeric vector of length 2, over which transformation is valued
