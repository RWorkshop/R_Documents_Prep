##``round_half_up ``

Round a numeric vector; halves will be rounded up, ala Microsoft Excel.

#### Description

In base R ``round()``, halves are rounded to even, e.g., 12.5 and 11.5 are both rounded to 12. This
function rounds 12.5 to 13 (assuming digits = 0). Negative halves are rounded away from zero,
e.g., -0.5 is rounded to -1.

This may skew subsequent statistical analysis of the data, but may be desirable in certain contexts.
This function is implemented exactly from http://stackoverflow.com/a/12688836; see that
question and comments for discussion of this issue.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
round_half_up(x, digits = 0)
</code></pre> 

#### Arguments
* ``x``: a numeric vector to round.
* ``digits``: how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point?

#### Examples
```{r}
round_half_up(12.5)
round_half_up(1.125, 2)
round_half_up(1.125, 1)
round_half_up(-0.5, 0) # negatives get rounded away from zero
```
