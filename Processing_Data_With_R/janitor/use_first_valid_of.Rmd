## ``use_first_valid_of`` Returns first non-NA value from a set of vectors.

#### Description

At each position of the input vectors, iterates through in order and returns the first non-NA value.
This is a robust replacement of the common ifelse(!is.na(x), x, ifelse(!is.na(y), y, z)).
It is more readable and handles problems like ifelse's inability to work with dates in this way.

#### Usage 

<pre><code>

use_first_valid_of(..., if_all_NA = NA)

</code></pre> 

#### Arguments
* ``...``: the input vectors. Order matters: these are searched and prioritized in the order they are supplied.
* ``if_all_NA``: what value should be used when all of the vectors return NA for a certain index? Default is NA.

#### Value
Returns a single vector with the selected values.

#### Warning
Deprecated, do not use in new code. Use dplyr::coalesce() instead.
