###Exercise} The following are measurements (in mm) of a critical
dimension on a sample of twelve engine crankshafts:

\begin{verbatim}
224.120 	224.001 	224.017 	223.982 	223.989 	223.961
223.960 	224.089 	223.987 	223.976 	223.902 	223.980
\end{verbatim}
(a) Calculate the mean and standard deviation for these data.
(b) The process mean is supposed to be ? = 224mm. Is this the
case? Give reasons for your answer.
(c) Construct a 99\% confidence interval for these data and interpret.
(d) Check that the normality assumption is valid using 2 suitable plots.

\begin{verbatim}
> x<-c(224.120,224.001,224.017,223.982 ,223.989 ,223.961,
+ 223.960 ,224.089 ,223.987 ,223.976 , 223.902 ,223.980)

> sd(x)
[1] 0.05785405

data:  x
t = -0.1796, df = 11, p-value = 0.8607

###Exercise 2} 
The height of 12 Americans and 10 Japanese was measured. Test for a difference in the heights of both populations.
\begin{verbatim}
Americans
174.68   	169.87 	   	165.07    	165.95 		204.99 		177.61

\end{verbatim}




###Exercise 4}
A poll on social issues interviewed 1025 people randomly selected from the United States. 450 of people said that they do not get enough time to themselves. A report claims that over 41\% of the population are not satisfied with personal time. Is this the case?

\begin{verbatim}

> prop.test(450,1025,p=0.40,alternative="greater")

        1-sample proportions test with continuity correction

data:  450 out of 1025, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 6.3425, df = 1, p-value = 0.005894

Exercise 23b:  A company wants to investigate the proportion of males and females promoted in the last year. 45 out of 400 female candidates were promoted, while 520 out of 3270 male candidates were promoted. Is there evidence of sexism in the company?
\begin{verbatim}

   prop 1    prop 2
0.1125000 0.1590214
\end{verbatim}

###Exercise}

Generate a histogram for data set 'scores', with an accompanying box-and-whisker plot.
The colour of the histogram's bar should be yellow. The orientation for the boxplot should be horizontal.

\begin{verbatim}
scores <-c(23,19,22,22,19,20,25,26,26,19,24,23,17,21,28,26)

par(mfrow=c(2,1)) 	# two rows , one column

hist(scores,main="Distribution of scores",xlab="scores",col="yellow")

boxplot(scores ,horizontal=TRUE)

par(mfrow =c(1,1)) 	#reset
\end{verbatim}
###The R Programming Language}

The R Programming Language is a statistical , data analysis , etc

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

###Writing R scripts}
Editing your R script ``R Editor".
\begin{itemize}
\item On the menu of the R console, click on file.
\item Select open script or new script as appropriate.
\item Navigate to your working directory and select your \texttt{.R} file
\item A new dialogue box ``\texttt{the R editor}" will open up.
\item Input or select code you wish to compile.
\item To compile this code, highlight it. Click the edit button on the menu.
\item Select either ``Run Line" or ``Run Selection or All".
\item Your code should now compile.
\item To save your code, clink on ``file" and then ``\texttt{save as}".
\item Save the file with the ``\texttt{.R}" extension to your working directory.
\end{itemize}

###Vector types}
\texttt{R} operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the
vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of
Numbers or characters.

\begin{itemize}
\item Numeric vectors
\item Character vectors
\item Logical vectors
\item (also complex number vectors and colour vectors)
\end{itemize}

To create a vector, use the assignment operator and the concatenate function.
For numeric vectors, the values are simply numbers.

\begin{verbatim}
># week8.r
>NumVec<-c(10.4,5.6,3.1,6.4)
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively we can use the \texttt{assign()} command

For character vectors, the values are simply characters, specified with
quotation marks.A logical vectors is a vector whose elements are TRUE, FALSE or NA

\begin{verbatim}
>CharVec<-c(``blue", ``green", ``yellow")
>LogVec<-c(TRUE, FALSE)
\end{verbatim}

###Graphical data entry interface}

\texttt{Data.entry()} is a useful  command for inputting or editing data sets. Any
changes are saved automatically (i.e. dont need to use the assignment
operator). We can also used the \texttt{edit()} command, which calls the \texttt{R Editor}.

\begin{verbatim}
>data.entry(NumVec)
>NumVec <- edit(NumVec)
\end{verbatim}

Another method of creating vectors is to use the following
\begin{verbatim}
numeric (length = n)
character (length = n)
logical (length = n)
\end{verbatim}
These commands create empty vectors, of the appropriate kind, of length $n$. You can then use the graphical data entry interface to populate your data sets.

\subsubsection{Accessing specified elements of a vector}

The $n$th element of vector ``Vec" can be accessed by specifying its index when
calling ``Vec".
\begin{verbatim}>Vec[n]
\end{verbatim}
A sequence of  elements of vector ``Vec" can be accessed by specifying its index
when calling ``Vec".
\begin{verbatim}>Vec[l:u]
\end{verbatim}
Omitting and deleting the $n$th element of vector ``Vec"
\begin{verbatim}
>Vec[-n]
>Vec <- Vec[-n]
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Packages}
The capabilities of R are extended through user-submitted packages, which allow specialized statistical techniques, graphical devices, as well as and
import/export capabilities to many external data formats.

###Managing Precision}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{floor()} - 
\item \texttt{ceiling()} - 
\item \texttt{round()} - 
\item \texttt{as.integer()} -
\end{itemize}

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> pi
[1] 3.141593
> floor(pi)
[1] 3
> ceiling(pi)
[1] 4
> round(pi,3)
[1] 3.142
> as.integer(pi)
[1] 3

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
>x^y
>exp(x)
>log(x)
>log(y)
#determining the square root of x
>sqrt(x)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsection{vectors}
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
R handles vector objects quite easily and intuitively.

> x<-c(1,3,2,10,5)    #create a vector x with 5 components
> x
[1]  1  3  2 10  5
> y<-1:5              #create a vector of consecutive integers
> y
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
> y+2                 #scalar addition
[1] 3 4 5 6 7
> 2*y                 #scalar multiplication
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
> y^2                 #raise each component to the second power
[1]  1  4  9 16 25
> 2^y                 #raise 2 to the first through fifth power
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
> y                   #y itself has not been unchanged
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
> y<-y*2
> y                   #it is now changed
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsubsection{Misc}
\texttt{seq()} and \texttt{rep()} are useful commands for constructing vectors with a certain pattern.

%\end{document}

\subsection{Matrices}
A matrix refers to a numeric array of rows and columns.

One of the easiest ways to create a matrix is to combine vectors of equal
length using cbind(), meaning "column bind". Alternatively one can use rbind(), meaning ``row bind".

###Summary Statistics}
The \texttt{R} command \texttt{summary()} returns a summary statistics for a simple dataset.
The \texttt{R} command \texttt{fivenum()} returns a summary statistics for a simple dataset, but without the mean.
Also, the quartiles are computed a different way.
