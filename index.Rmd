### Pycon Limerick 2020

PyCon Limerick 2020 will be returing to Limerick on Saturday 29th February 2020.
This one day conference is a mixture of talks and workshops on topics related to the Python Programming Language.

Python Ireland is the Irish organization representing the various chapters of Python users. 
One of our key activities is the organization of Python Conferences. We have organized PyCon Ireland in Dublin over the last ten years.

PyCon Ireland is now a highlight in the Dublin Tech Community calendar, with 400 python users attending the conference each autumn. PyCons are very popular with companies looking to recruit new talent.

PyCon Limerick will take place on Saturday 29th February 2020 at the Strand Hotel Limerick.
We hope to bring 150-200 technologists and coders from around Ireland to the city next Spring.

Abstracts for Morning Session 1

### Room 1

<h5>GraphQL with Python </h5>


* The talk will be about GraphQL technology. What is GraphQL and why we might use it. 
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GraphQL. 
* I will talk about the main concepts in GraphQL like schemas, types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
* I will show how to implement GraphQL with python using an example with Graphene and Django. 
* I will have a demo with a sample app build in Django that will serve as a GraphQL API.



### Room 2






<h5> Social Network Analysis of the 1916 rising (James Nagle)</h5>

In 2015 the National Archives released files which had been compiled by the Dublin Metropolitan Police 100 years beforehand. From June 1915 to April 1916 they followed members of groups such as Sinn F?in, the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League and reported on who they were seen talking to. Using these files, the python library networkX and the open source network analysis package Gephi, I was able to build a social network of the interactions recorded.


### Room 3

<h5>Building smarter solutions with no expertise in machine learning (Laurent Picard)</h5>


<h5> ELK Stack with Python for Effective Logging	(Kartik Sharma)</h5>

System logging becomes one of the necessary parts in system design because of the large scale and a wide variety of data information systems are handling. Through this platform, I want to give our techies and other people in the audience an insight into the importance of logging and facilitating its features through ELK stack. ELK stands for Elastic, Logstash and Kibana, Through these 3 technologies, developers can create, store and visualize the working of the systems. These visualization also helps all the stakeholders with the relevant information of the system health. Daily cron or triggers can be set up in order to monitor the health of the system continuously.
