Another method of creating vectors is to use the following
<code>
numeric (length = n)
character (length = n)
logical (length = n)
</code>
These commands create empty vectors, of the appropriate kind, of length $n$. You can then use the graphical data entry interface to populate your data sets.

\subsubsection{Accessing specified elements of a vector}

The $n$th element of vector ``Vec" can be accessed by specifying its index when
calling ``Vec".
<code>>Vec[n]
</code>
A sequence of  elements of vector ``Vec" can be accessed by specifying its index
when calling ``Vec".
<code>>Vec[l:u]
</code>
Omitting and deleting the $n$th element of vector ``Vec"
<code>
>Vec[-n]
>Vec <- Vec[-n]
</code>
