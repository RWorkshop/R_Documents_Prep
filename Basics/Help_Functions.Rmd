\subsection{1.6 Help Functions}
Help files for R functions are accessed by preceding the name of the function with ? (e.g. ?sort
). Alternatively you can use the command help() (e.g. ?sqrt
A HTML document appears on screen with information on the function typed in. As well
as the list of arguments that the particular function accepts, and how to specify them, there is
example code at the bottom of the file. These code segments are often invaluable in learning
how to master the function.

\subsection{1.7 The help.start() command}
As mentioned by the text on the main console, the help.start() command can be usd to
access detailed help documentation that comes as part of the installation.

\subsection{1.9 Basic R Editor}
R has an inbuilt script editor. We will use it for this class, but there are plenty of top quality
Integrated Development Environments out there. (Read up about RStudio for example).
For these workshops, we will use the in-built script editor.
To start a new script, or open an existing script simply go to File and click the appropriate
options. A new dialogue box will appear. You can write and edit code using this editor.
To pass the code for compiling , press the run line or selection option (The third icon
on the menu).
Another way to read code is to use the edit() function , which operates directly from the
command line. To see how the code defining an object X was written (or more importantly,
could have been written) simply type edit(X). This command has some useful applications
that we will see later on.
Scripts are saved as .R files. These scripts can be called directly using the source() com-
mand.
