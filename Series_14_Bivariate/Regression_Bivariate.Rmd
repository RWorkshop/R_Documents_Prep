### Confidence Interval for Regression Estimate}
To compute the confidence intervals for both estimates, we use the \texttt\textbf{{confint()*** command, specifying the name of the fitted model.

```{r}
C=c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12)
F=c(2.1,5.0,9.0,12.6,17.3,21.0,24.7)
Fit1=lm(F~C)
coef(Fit1)
# (Intercept)        Conc
     1.517857    1.930357

confint(Fit1)
#               2.5 %   97.5 %
# (Intercept) 0.75970 2.276014
# Conc        1.82522 2.035495
```


### The Coefficient of Determination}
The coefficient of determination $R^2$ is the proportion of variability in a data set that is accounted for by the linear model.

Equivalently $R^2$ provides a measure of how well future outcomes are likely to be predicted by the model.

(For simple linear regression, it canbe computed by squaring the correlation coefficient.)


```{r}
summary(fit1)$r.squared
```

The estimates (i.e regression coefficients) may be determined directly using the 
coef() command.
