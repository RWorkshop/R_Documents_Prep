\begin{slide}{Correlation}
\begin{itemize}

* The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. *  It is referred to as Pearson's correlation or simply as the correlation coefficient. * If the relationship between the variables is not linear, then the correlation coefficient does not adequately represent the strength of the relationship between the variables.
\end{itemize}
<p>

%------------------------------------------



\begin{slide}{Correlation}
\begin{itemize}
* To compute the Pearson correlation coefficient (``r"), we use the ``cor()" command.
\begin{verbatim}
> cor(x,y)
[1] 0.9581898
\end{verbatim}
* The coefficient should be between $-1$ and $1$.
* Recall, the higher the absolute value of the correlation coefficient, the stronger the linear relationship.
* A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship.
* A negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative (inverse) relationship.
\end{itemize}
<p>

\begin{slide}{Correlation and Covariance}
\begin{itemize}
* Other types of correlation coefficient are possible, such as the Spearman coefficient, and the Kendall Tau coefficient.
* To specify one of these methods, add the argument to the command, as shown below.
 \begin{verbatim}
> cor(x,y,method="kendall")
[1] 0.7878788
> cor(x,y,method="spearman")
[1] 0.909091
\end{verbatim}

* To compute the covariance, we use the ``cov()" command.
\begin{verbatim}
> cov(x,y)
[1] 1.824429
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{Simple Linear Regression}



\begin{itemize}
* Basic regression model :
$y=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \epsilon$

\item
The intercept $\beta_{0}$ describes the point at which the line intersects
the y axis
* The slope $\beta_{1}$ describes the change in `y'  for every unit increase in `x'.

* From the data set, we determine the regression coefficients, i.e estimates for slope and intercept.

\begin{itemize}
\item
 $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ : the intercept estimate.
* $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ : the slope estimate.
\end{itemize}
* Fitted model : $\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x $
\end{itemize}


<p>

%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{The lm() command.}
\begin{itemize}
* The command lm() is used to fit linear models. * Firstly the response variable is specified, then the predictor variable. * The tilde sign is used to denote the dependent relationship (i.e. y depends on x).
* The regression coefficients are then determined.
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
> lm(y~x)

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x
     0.7812       0.8581
\end{verbatim}

<p>
%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{Simple linear regression}
\begin{itemize} * A more detailed model (i.e. more than just the coefficients) is generated in the form of a data object. * We can give a name to the model, and view all of the results of the calculation, including \begin {itemize} * The regression coefficients \item
The fitted $\hat{y}$ values (i.e. the estimated `y' values for the x date set) * The residuals (i.e. the differences between  the estimated `y' values and the observed `y' values). \end{itemize}\item
In common with all data structures we can use the names() function and `\$' to access components.\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Simple Linear Regression}
An alternative method is to use the following commands.
\begin{itemize}
* coef() - returns the regression coefficients of the model.
* fitted() - returns the fitted values of the model.
* resid() - returns the residuals of the model.


\end{itemize}
 \begin{verbatim}
 > coef(fit1)
(Intercept)           x
  0.7812216   0.8580521

\begin{slide}{Coefficient of Determination}
\begin{itemize}
* The coefficient of determination $R^2$ is  the proportion of variability in a data set
that is accounted for by the linear model.
* $R^2$ provides a measure of how well future outcomes are likely to be predicted by the model.
* For simple linear regression, it can also be computed by squaring the correlation coefficient.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
> summary(fit1)$r.squared
[1] 0.9181277
\end{verbatim}

%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{p-values}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We will begin to use hypothesis testing in out analyses.
* We will mostly be using ``p-values".
* If the p-value is very low, we reject the null hypothesis.
* If it is above an arbitrary threshold, we ``fail to reject" the null hypothesis.
* We will use 0.01 (1\%) as our arbitrary threshold.
* The relevant hypotheses will be discussed for each methodology.
\end{itemize}
<p>

%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{Inference for regression}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We can use the ``summary()" command to determine
test statistics and p-values for the both
regression coefficients.
* In both cases the null hypothesis is that the true value is zero.
* Consequently the alternative hypothesis is that they are not zero in both cases.
* Stating that the slope is zero is equivalent to saying that there is no relationship between `x' and `y'.
\end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}
<p>
%------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{Inference for regression}
\begin{itemize}
* The p value for the intercept is 0.209. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis that true intercept is zero.
* The p value for the slope is extremely small. This means we reject the null hypothesis that it is zero.
* Consequently we reject the hypothesis that there is no relationship between `x' and `y'.
* Notice that the stars beside the p-value. The more stars, the lower the p-value.
\end{itemize}
