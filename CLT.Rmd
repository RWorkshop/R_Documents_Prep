Hypothesis testing and con dence interval construction are based on the Central Limit Theorem.
CLT - see Introductory Data Analysis notes by Dr. Ailish Hannigan.
Can check the CLT using a small simulation example.
We will take 10000 samples of size 5 from data with a uniform distribution and record the means.
When we plot a histogram of the means, should have a normal distribution.
 
means <- numeric(10000)
for(i in 1:10000){
means[i] <- mean(runif(5))
}
hist(means)
 

Recall the Dice experiment in week 8.
 
N=100                                         #number of loops
Avgs=numeric(N)                       #array “Avgs” store the sample means
for( i in 1:N)
              {              Dice=floor(runif(50,min=1,max=7));              Avgs[i]=mean(Dice);
              }
Avgs                                         #print Avgs dataset to screen
 
The Central limit theorem states that.

The “Dice” distribution is a discrete uniform distribution. However

mean(Avgs)                                #compute the mean. Is it roughly what we are expecting?
qqnorm(Avgs)                                #draws a QQ plot that is used to check for normality.
qqline(Avgs)                                #adds trend line to QQplot.
shapiro.test(Avgs)                       #Shapiro Wilk test. Normality is assumed if p-value > 0.05.
