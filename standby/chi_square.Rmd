\section{Working with Categorical Data}
\subsection{Chi-Square}

The table below shows the relationship between gender and party identification in a US state.


%   & Democrat &Independent & Republican & Total \\
%Male   &279& 73  &225 &577 \\
%Female &165& 47  & 191 &403 \\
%Total  &444 & 120 &416&   980 \\

Test for association between gender and party affiliation at two appropriate levels
and comment on your results.

Set out the null hypothesis that there is no association between method of computation
and gender against the alternative, that there is. Be careful to get these the correct way
round!

H0: There is no association.
H1: There is an association.

Work out the expected values. For example, you should work out the expected value for
the number of males who use no aids from the following: (95/195) Ã— 22 = 10.7.


\section{Probability Distributions}
\subsection{Discrete Probability Distribution}


The two most accessible discrete distributions are the binomial and \textbf{\emph{Poisson}} distributions
