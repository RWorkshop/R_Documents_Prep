{1.11 The summary() command}


* The R command ``summary()`` is a generic function used to produce result “summaries” of the
results of various objects, from simple vectors to the output of complex model fitting functions.
* The function invokes particular methods which depend on the class of the first argument.

{1.12 Working directories}


* You can change your working directly by using the appropriate options on the File menu. 
* To
determine the current working directory, you can use the ``getwd()`` command. 
* To change the
working directory , we would use the ``setwd()`` command.
*  This is quite important as objects
will be imported and exported to and from the specified directory.

{1.13 Coming Unstuck}
\Large

*  If you are having trouble with a piece of code that is currently compiling , all you have to do is press ESC, just like many other computing environments.
  

%===

{1.14 Quitting the R environment}
As the front page text indicates, all you have to do to quite the workspace is to type in ``q()``.
You will then be prompted to save your work.

%===

{1.15 Data Objects}
As mentioned previously, R saves data as \textbf{objects}. Examples of data objects are

* Vectors
* Lists
* Dataframes
* Matrices

The simple objects we have created previously are simply single element vectors.

%===

{1.16 Listing all items in a workspace}
To list all items in an R environment, we use the ``ls()`` function. This provides a list of all data
objects accessible. Another useful command is ``objects()``.
\begin{figure}

%\caption{}
%\label{fig:ObjectsList}
\end{figure}


%===

{1.17 Removing items}

* Sometimes it is desirable to save a subset of your workspace instead of the entire workspace.
* One option is to use the ``rm()`` function to remove unwanted objects right before exiting your R
session; another possibility is to use the ``save()`` function.




 
%===

{1.19 Saving and Loading R Data Objects}
In situations where a good deal of processing must be used on a raw dataset in order to prepare
it for analysis, it may be prudent to save the R objects you create in their internal binary form.
One attractive feature of this scheme is that the objects created can be read by R programs
running on different computer architectures than the one on which they were created, making it
very easy to move your data between different computers. Each time an R session is completed,
you are prompted to save the workspace image, which is a binary file called .RData in the
working directory.

%===

Whenever R encounters such a file in the working directory at the beginning of a session,
it automatically loads it making all your saved objects available again. So one method for

saving your work is to always save your workspace image at the end of an R session. If you
would like to save your workspace image at some other time during your R session, you can use
the save.image() function, which, when called with no arguments, will also save the current
workspace to a file called .RData in the working directory.

{2.1 Some particularly useful commands}


The Holy Trinity

* ``help()``
* ``summary()``
* ``help.start()``
* ``apropos()``



%===

{2.2 Changing GUI options}

* We can change the GUI options using the GUI preferences option on the Edit menu.
*  (Important
when teaching R) 
* A demonstration will be done in class.



%===

{2.3 Colours}

* R supported a massive number of colours.
* Type in colours() (or colors()) to see what colours
are supported.

%===

{2.4 Use of the Semi-Colon Operator}

* The semi-colon operator at the end of each line of code is not necessary in general, but using it
overcomes errors due to copying and pasting from document soft copies. 
* It is also useful for compacting multiple short statements onto a single line.
* In other programming
languages, such as Octave, using the semicolon in this way has a distinct purpose.


%===

{2.5 The ``apropos()`` Function}

* This function is very useful for determining what functions are available for a particular topic,
although the process requires a great deal of trial and error. 
* Suppose we are looking for a
command to print out the session information. 
* We would use a very short string (e.g. \textbf{essio})
that would plausibly be part of useful function names.

* The command ``history()`` is used to obtain the last 25 commands used by ``R}.
* 25 is the default number, you can specify another number.

{2.7 The ``sessionInfo()`` Function}
To get a description of the version of R and its attached packages used in the current session,
we can use the ``sessionInfo()`` function

{2.8 Time and date functions}

* The commands ``Sys.time()`` and ``Sys.Date()`` returns the system’s idea of the current date
with and without time. 
* We can perform some simple algebraic calculations to compute time
differences (i.e. to find out how long some code took to compile).
