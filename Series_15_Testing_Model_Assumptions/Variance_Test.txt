\subsection{Test for Equality of Variance (a)}
\begin{itemize}
*  In this procedure, we determine whether or not two populations have the same variance.
*  The assumption of equal variance of two populations underpins several inference procedures. This assumption is tested by comparing the variance of samples taken from both populations.
*  We will not get into too much detail about that, but concentrate on how to assess equality of variance.
*  The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
\[ H_0: \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 \]
\[ H_1: \sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2 \]
\end{itemize}


%----------------------------------------%

\subsection{Test for Equality of Variance (b)}
\begin{itemize}
*  When using \texttt{R} it would be convenient to consider the null and alternative in terms of variance ratios.
*  Two data sets have equal variance if the variance ratio is 1.
*  \textbf{Remark} : This is a two-tailed test.
\end{itemize}

\[ H_0: \sigma^2_1 / \sigma^2_2 = 1 \]
\[ H_1: \sigma^2_1 / \sigma^2_2 \neq 1 \]

%----------------------------------------%
% - x=c(14,13,16,20,12,18,11,09,13,11)
% - y=c(15,13,18,20,10,17,23,11,10)
%----------------------------------------%

\subsection{Test for Equality of Variance(c)}
You would be required to compute the test statistic for this procedure.
The test statistic is the ratio of the variances for both data sets.
\[ TS = \frac{s^2_x}{s^2_y} \]
The standard deviations would be provided in the \texttt{R} code. \begin{itemize}
*  Sample standard deviation for data set $x$ = 3.40
*  Sample standard deviation for data set $y$ = 4.63
\end{itemize}
To compute the test statistic.
\[ TS = \frac{3.40^2}{4.63^2} = \frac{11.56}{21.43} = 0.5394 \]


%----------------------------------------%

\subsection{Variance Test (d)}
\begin{verbatim}
> var.test(x,y)

F test to compare two variances

data:  x and y
F = 0.5394, num df = 9, denom df = 8, p-value = 0.3764
alternative hypothesis: 
true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
0.1237892 2.2125056
sample estimates:
ratio of variances
0.5393782
\end{verbatim}


%----------------------------------------%


\subsection{Variance Test (e)}
\begin{itemize}
*  The p-value is 0.3764 (top right), above the threshold level of 0.0250.
*  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
*  There is not enough evidence to say there is a difference in variance between the two populations.
\smallskip
*  We can assume that there is no significant difference in sample variances. Therefore we can assume that both populations have equal variance.
*  Additionally the $95\%$ confidence interval (0.1237, 2.2125) contains the null values i.e. 1.
\end{itemize}




%----------------------------------------%
% - x=c(14,13,16,20,12,18,11,09,13,11)
% - y=c(15,13,18,20,10,17,23,11,10)
%----------------------------------------%



%----------------------------------------%


\textbf{Variance Test (e)}
\begin{itemize}
*  The p-value is 0.3764 (top right), above the threshold level of 0.0250.
*  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
*  We can assume that there is no significant difference in sample variances. Therefore we can assume that both populations have equal variance.
*  Additionally the $95\%$ confidence interval (0.1237, 2.2125) contains the null values i.e. 1.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test(a)}


\begin{itemize}
*  We will often be required to determine whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
*  Again, this assumption underpins many statistical models.
*  The null hypothesis is that the data set is normally distributed.
*  The alternative hypothesis is that the data set is not normally distributed.
*  One procedure for testing these hypotheses is the Shapiro-Wilk test, implemented in \texttt{R} using the command \texttt{shapiro.test()}.
*  (Remark: You will not be required to compute the test statistic for this test.)
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------%

\textbf{Shapiro Wilk Test(b)}
For the data set used previously; $x$ and $y$, we use the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine that both data sets are normally distributed.
\begin{verbatim}

> shapiro.test(x)

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  x
W = 0.9474, p-value = 0.6378

> shapiro.test(y)

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  y
W = 0.9347, p-value = 0.5273
\end{verbatim}




%-------------------------------------------------%

\textbf{Graphical Procedures for assessing Normality}

\begin{itemize}
*  The normal probability (Q-Q) plot is a very useful tool for determining whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
*  Interpretation is simple. If the points follow the trendline (provided by the second line of \texttt{R} code \texttt{qqline}).
*  One should expect minor deviations. Numerous major deviations would lead the analyst to conclude that the data set is not normally distributed.
*  The Q-Q plot is best used in conjunction with a formal procedure such as the Shapiro-Wilk test.
\end{itemize}

>qqnorm(CWdiff)

\textbf{The paired t-test with \texttt{R}}
\vspace{-1cm}
\begin{itemize}
*  Previously we have seen the paired $t-$test. It is used to determine whether or
not there is a significant difference between paired measurements. *  Equivalently whether or not
the case-wise differences are zero.
*  The mean and standard deviation of the case-wise differences are used to determine the test statistic.
*  Under the null hypothesis, the expected value of the case-wise differences is zero (i.e $H_0 : \mu_d = 0$).
%*  The test statistic is computed as
%\[ TS = \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_d}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} \]
\end{itemize}






%------------------------------------------%

\textbf{The paired t-test with \texttt{R}}

\begin{itemize}
*  In the following procedure (next slide), there are two sets of values: the \texttt{Before} values and the \texttt{After} values.
*  The \texttt{R} command is \texttt{t.test()}, with the additional specification ``\texttt{paired=}".
*  The alternative hypothesis is specified in the output. ( Another way of expressing it: True mean of case-wise differences is not zero)
*  Also included in the output is a 95\% confidence interval for the sample mean of case-wise differences.
\end{itemize}





%----------------------------------------%


\textbf{Test for Equality of Variance}
\begin{itemize}
*  The $p-$value is 0.3764 (top right), above the threshold level of 0.0250.
*  We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
*  We can assume that there is no significant difference in sample variances. Therefore we can assume that both populations have equal variance.
*  Additionally the $95\%$ confidence interval (0.1237, 2.2125) contains the expected value under the assumption of equal variance i.e. 1.
\end{itemize}
