### Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (a)}
The null hypothesis is that two populations have the same proportions for a particular characteristic.
\[H_0 : \pi_1 = \pi_2 \]
\[H_1 : \pi_1 \neq \pi_2 \]

*  The command is \texttt{prop.test(c(x1,x2),c(n1,n2))}
*  $x1$ and $x2$ are the number of successes from both samples.
*  $n2$ and $n2$ are the sample sizes for both groups.
*  The difference in population proportions assumed under the null hypothesis is zero.
*  (It is possible to specify a different null value, but we will not consider this in this module.)

### Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (b)}

*  Consider a study where the proportion of Irish students who owned mobile devices, such as iphones and androids was compared to the corresponding proportion of French student.
*  As before, $65$ Irish students were interviewed, with $50$ replying that they owned mobile devices.
*  $90$ french students were interview, with 60 responding that they owned mobile devices.
*  The test of equality of proportions is implemented on the next slide.

### Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (c)}
Based on the p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to assume a difference in proportions. Also the expected difference assumed under the null hypothesis, i.e. 0, is contained in the confidence interval.

### Test of Equality for Two Sample Proportions (d)}

*  You would be required to compute the differences in observed proportions.
*  Additionally you will given the <tt>R</tt> code for one sample procedures. This may or may not be relevant for answering the question.
