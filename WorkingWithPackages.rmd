if("raster" %in% (.packages())){
  detach("package:raster", unload=TRUE) 
}

if("MASS" %in% (.packages())){
  detach("package:MASS", unload=TRUE) 
}


### Here's what each part does:

- **`.packages()`** lists the names of all packages currently attached (i.e., loaded via `library()` or `require()`).
- **`"raster" %in% (.packages())`** checks if the `raster` package is among them.
- If `TRUE`, then **`detach("package:raster", unload=TRUE)`** unloads and detaches the `raster` package from the session.

The same logic is repeated for the **`MASS`** package.

### Why do this?

This kind of check-and-detach is useful if:
- You're trying to prevent **namespace conflicts**â€”especially if different packages define functions with the same name.
- You're cleaning up your workspace before running new models or packages that might clash with existing ones.
- You're scripting a reproducible environment where specific packages shouldn't be active at a given point.
