## Logical Functions and Coercion

- `as.vector`
- `is.na`
  - `NA` is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator.
  - Missing value/not available.

## Regression Models and Bivariate Data

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- `lm()`
  - Used to fit linear models. Can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance.

## Control Loops

- `do`
- `if`

## Writing Functions

## Goodness of Fit Statistics

- AIC
