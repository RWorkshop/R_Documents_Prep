## Correlation and Regression Tests

### Correlation Coefficient

Strength of a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

```R
M = 1000
CorrData = numeric(M)
for (i in 1:M) {
  CorrData[i] = cor(rnorm(10), rnorm(10))
}
```

The null hypothesis is that the correlation coefficient is zero.

The alternative hypothesis is that the correlation coefficient is greater than zero.

### The Slope and Intercept Estimates

These tests are given in the "Two Tailed" format. The one-tailed format compares a null hypothesis where the parameter of interest has a true value of less than or equal to one versus an alternative hypothesis stating that it has a value greater than zero.

#### Graphical Procedures
- Various methods to visualize data and statistical results.

#### Inference Procedures (t-tests)
- Methods to draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data.

- Techniques to model the relationship between variables.



### Model Fitting

#### Regression Models and Bivariate Data

- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- `lm()`: Used to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance.

#### Goodness of Fit Statistics

- **AIC()**: Akaike Information Criterion for model comparison.
