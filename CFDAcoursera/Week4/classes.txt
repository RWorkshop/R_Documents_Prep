S is a functional language, and methods in the language are function-based, not class-based.
The most commonly encountered languages emphasizing methods follow what is generally called the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model; more precisely, the languages follow a class-based organization of software. For the most part, programming is organized around the definition of classes of objects. Methods are invoked on an object. In S-style notation,


        x$plot(y)
      
invokes the plot method on the object x, passing it an argument y.
