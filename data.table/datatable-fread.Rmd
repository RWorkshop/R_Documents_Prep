"""### NYC Flights Data

We will use NYC-flights14 data. It contains On-Time flights data from the Bureau of Transporation Statistics for all the flights that departed from New York City airports in 2014 (inspired by nycflights13). The data is available only for Jan-Octâ14.

### ``fread()``
We can use data.tableâs fast file reader ``fread()`` to load flights directly as follows:
"""

flights <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/arunsrinivasan/flights/NYCflights14/flights14.csv")
