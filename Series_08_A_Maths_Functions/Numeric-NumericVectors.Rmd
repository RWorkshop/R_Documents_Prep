### Vectors and assignment

R operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the numeric vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of numbers. 
To set up a vector
named x, say, consisting of five numbers, namely 10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4 and 21.7, use the R command

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
\end{verbatim}

This is an assignment statement using the function c()


x=c(x,16)

adding a value
deleting a value
x=x[-9]
length()
