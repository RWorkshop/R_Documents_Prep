## Basic Maths Operations
The most commonly used mathematical operators are all supported by R. \\Here are a few
 examples:
 
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 5 + 3 * 5 # Note the order of operations.
 log (10) # Natural logarithm with base e=2.718282
 log(8,2) # Log to the base 2
 4^2 # 4 raised to the second power
 7/2 # Division
 factorial(4) #Factorial of Four
 sqrt (25) # Square root
 abs (3-7) # Absolute value of 3-7
 pi # The mysterious number \\\
 exp(2) # exponential function
 \end{semiverbatim}

 \texttt{R} can be used for many mathematical operations, including
 
 
*  Set Theory
*  Trigonometry
*  Complex Numbers
*  Binomial Coefficients

 Set Theory is always useful to know. We will not go into any of the others in great detail today.
