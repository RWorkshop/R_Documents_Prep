<h4>Matrix Multiplication<h4>
To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; $"\%*\%"$.
If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
<!--begin.rcode
A * B  		#Element-wise multiplication
A %*% B  	#Matrix multiplication
end.rcode-->

We can compute crossproducts using the crossprod () command. If only one matrix is used it
<!--begin.rcode
crossprod(A,B) 		# A'B
crossprod(A) 			# A'A
end.rcode-->
Diagonals
The diag() command is a very versatile function for using matrices.
It can be used to create a diagonal matrix with elements of a vector in the principal diagonal. For an existing matrix, it can be used to return a vector containing the elements of the principal diagonal.


Most importantly, if k is a scalar, diag() will create a k x k identity matrix.
<!--begin.rcode
Vec2=c(1,2,3)
diag(Vec2)	#	Constructs a diagonal matrix based on values of Vec2
diag(A)	#        Returns diagonal elements of A as a vector
diag(3)	#	creates a 3 x 3 identity matrix
diag(diag(A)) #  	Diagonal matrix D of matrix A ( Jacobi Method)
end.rcode-->


<h3>Row and Column Statistics}
Statistic on the rows and columns can easily be computed if required.
<!--begin.rcode
rowMeans(A)  # Returns vector of row means.
rowSums(A)  # Returns vector of row sums.
colMeans(A)  # Returns vector of column means.
colSums(A)  # Returns vector of coumn means.
end.rcode-->



\section{Matrices}
A matrix refers to a numeric array of rows and columns.

One of the easiest ways to create a matrix is to combine vectors of equal
length using <code>cbind()</code>, meaning "column bind". Alternatively one can use  <code>rbind()</code>, meaning ``row bind".

		<h3>Creating a matrix}
		Matrices can be created using the <code>matrix()</code> command. The arguments to be supplied are 1) vector of values to be entered
		2) Dimensions of the matrix, specifying either the numbers of rows or columns.
		
		Additionally you can specify if the values are to be allocated by row or column. By default they are allocated by column.
		<!--begin.rcode
		Vec1=c(1,4,5,6,4,5,5,7,9)		# 9 elements
		A=matrix(Vec,nrow=3)		#3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by column.
		A
		B= matrix(c(1,6,7,0.6,0.5,0.3,1,2,1),ncol=3,byrow =TRUE)
		B				          #3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by row.
		end.rcode-->	
		If you have assigned values by column, but require that they are assigned by row, you can use the transpose function
		<!--begin.rcode
		t().
		t(A)				# Transpose
		A=t(A)	
		end.rcode-->
		
		Another methods of creating a matrix is to "bind" a number of vectors together, either by row or by column. The commands are rbind() and cbind() respectively.
		<!--begin.rcode
		x1 =c(1,2) ; x2 = c(3,6)
		rbind(x1,x2)
		cbind(x1,x2)
		end.rcode-->
		
		
			
			Particular rows and columns can be accessed by specifying the row number or column number, leaving the other value blank.
			<!--begin.rcode
			A[1,]	  # access first row of A
			B[,2]   # access first column of B
			end.rcode-->
			Addition and subtractions
			For matrices, addition and subtraction works on an element- wise basis. The first elements of the respective matrices are added, and so on.
			A+B
			A-B
			
			Matrix Multiplication
			To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; "%*%".
			If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
			<!--begin.rcode
			
			A * B  		#Element-wise multiplication
			A %*% B  	#Matrix multiplication
			end.rcode-->
			We can compute crossproducts using the crossprod () command. If only one matrix is used it
			<!--begin.rcode
				<!--begin.rcode
				crossprod(A,B) 		# A'B
				crossprod(A) 			# A'A
				end.rcode-->
			\end{framed}
		
				Row and Column Statistics.
			Statistic on the rows and columns can easily be computed if required.
			%rowMeans(A)  # Returns vector of row means.
			%rowSums(A)  # Returns vector of row sums.
			%colMeans(A)  # Returns vector of column means.
			%colSums(A)  # Returns vector of coumn means.
		\end{document}

		
		A particular row can be accessed by specifying the row index , while leaving the column index empty
		
		<!--begin.rcode
		Info [4,]			# Fourth row of "Info" is called
		
		A sequence of rows can be accessed by specifying a sequence of rows as follows.
		
		Info [10:15,]		# tenth row to fifteenth row of "Info" is called
		
	end.rcode-->
<!--begin.rcode
summary(cars)
end.rcode-->

<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>

<!--begin.rcode fig.width=7, fig.height=6
plot(cars)
end.rcode-->
