\subsubsection{Linear Algebra Functions}

\texttt{R} supports many import linear algebra functions such as cholesky 
decomposition, trace, rank, eigenvalues etc.

The required results may be determinable from the output of a command that 
pertains to an overall approach.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed using the eigen() function.  
A data object known as a list is then created.

\begin{verbatim}
eigen(A)       #eigenvalues and eigenvectors

qr(A)          #returns Rank of a matrix

svd(A)
\end{verbatim}
This is a very important type of matrix analysis, and many will encounter 
it again in future modules.


%------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
Y = eigen(A)
names(Y)

#   y$val are the eigenvalues of A
#   y$vec are the eigenvectors of A
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsubsection{More on Matrices}

Note that the following commands are often useful.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{rowMeans()}
\item \texttt{rowSums()}
\item \texttt{colMeans()}
\item \texttt{colSums()}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Using rbind() and cbind()}
Another methods of creating a matrix is to ``bindï¿½ a number of vectors 
together, either by row or by column. 
The commands are rbind() and cbind() respectively.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> x1 =c(1,2) ; x2 = c(3,8)

> D= rbind(x1,x2)

> E = cbind(x1,x2)

> det(D)

[1] 2

> det(E)

[1] 2
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsubsection{Solving a System of Linear Equations}

To solve a system of linear equations in the form Ax=b , where A is a square matrix, 
and b is a column vector of known values, we use the solve() command to determine 
the values of the unknown vector x.

%------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
b=vec2  # from before

solve(A, b)

\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
