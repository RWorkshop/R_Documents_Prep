### Matrix Multiplication


To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; $"\%*\%"$.
If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
<pre><code>
A * B  		#Element-wise multiplication
A %*% B  	#Matrix multiplication
</code></pre>

We can compute crossproducts using the crossprod () command. If only one matrix is used it
<pre><code>
crossprod(A,B) 		# A'B
crossprod(A) 			# A'A
</code></pre>

{Matrix Multiplication}

To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; %*%.

If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
This type of operation is very useful as a substitute for �for� loops on many occasions.



<pre>
<code>
 A %*% C
#     [,1] [,2] [,3]
#[1,]  9.6 19.0 13.8
#[2,] 13.4 40.0 36.2
#[3,] 17.0 50.5 45.5

 A*C
#     [,1] [,2] [,3]
#[1,]  1.0   36 35.0
#[2,]  2.4    2  2.1
#[3,]  5.0   10  9.0
