 \frametitle{1.3 The Assignment operator}
 
*  The assignment operator is used to assign names to particular values. 
*  Historically the assignment
 operator was ) a ``\texttt{<-}”. 
*  The assignment operator can also be the equals sign "=". (This is valid as of \texttt{R}
 version 1.4.0.)
 
*  Both will be used, although, you should learn one and stick with it. Many long term \texttt{R}
 users prefer the arrow approach.

 You can also use -> as an assignment operator, reversing the
 usual assignment positions. (This is actually really useful). Commands are separated either by
 a semi colon or by a newline.
 \begin{framed}
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 > a <- 6
 > b = 5
 > a + b ->c
 > c
 [1] 11
 >e=7;f<-4
 \end{semiverbatim}
 \end{framed}
 
 \end{document}

 \textbf{objects}
 
*  R stores both data and output from data analysis (as well as everything else) in \textbf{objects}.
*  The variables we have created so far are objects. 
*  A list of all objects in the current session can
 be obtained with ls().
