## Tutorial: Analyzing Fabric Durability with ANOVA in R

### Problem Overview

This experiment is designed to investigate how three manufacturing parameters affect the **durability (wear resistance)** of a textile fabric:

- **Filler Type (Filler)**: A material added to enhance durability.
- **Proportion Level (Proportion)**: How much filler is used.
- **Surface Treatment (Surface)**: Whether the fabric has undergone surface treatment or not.

The goal is to determine which of these factors, alone or in combination, significantly impacts how much wear the fabric experiences. This can inform cost-effective production strategies without compromising durability.

### 1. Preparing the Dataset

You start by defining the **response variable**:

```r
FabricWear = c(527, 561, 456, 377, 475, 466, 296, 325, 
               621, 664, 426, 476, 561, 540, 301, 235, 
               724, 743, 460, 426, 626, 682, 322, 304)
```

This represents observed wear values for each fabric sample under different conditions.

Next, you define three **categorical factors** representing experimental conditions:

```r
Filler = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 
                  1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2), 
                labels = c("F1", "F2"))

Proportion = factor(rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 8), 
                    labels = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3"))

Surface = factor(rep(c(1, 2), each = 4, times = 3), 
                 labels = c("T0", "T1"))
```

Now, combine them into one data frame:

```r
Experiment = data.frame(FabricWear, Filler, Proportion, Surface)
```

This structure allows analysis of how each factor and their interactions affect FabricWear.

### 2. Fitting ANOVA Models

You apply ANOVA to analyze the variance in wear due to the three factors.

#### Model 1: Full Interaction

```r
Model1 = aov(FabricWear ~ Filler * Proportion * Surface)
```

This model includes:
- All **main effects**: impact of each factor individually.
- All **two-way interactions**: combined impact of any two factors.
- The **three-way interaction**: joint impact of all three factors.

#### Model 2: Reduced Model (No Three-Way Interaction)

```r
Model2 = aov(FabricWear ~ Filler * Proportion * Surface - Filler:Proportion:Surface)
```

This model excludes the three-way interaction, testing whether simpler models still explain the data effectively.

---

### 3. Model Evaluation and Comparison

To interpret the models:

```r
summary(Model1)
summary(Model2)
anova(Model1, Model2)  # Optional model comparison
```

- If the three-way interaction is **not significant**, Model2 might be preferable due to its simpler structure.
- Significant main or two-way effects reveal which factors influence fabric durability.

### Additional Notes

- Itâ€™s good practice to validate model assumptions: normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance.
- For visualization and deeper insights, consider using plots such as `interaction.plot`, `boxplot`, or `ggplot2`.
- If needed, you can refine the analysis using `car::Anova()` for Type II or III sums of squares.
