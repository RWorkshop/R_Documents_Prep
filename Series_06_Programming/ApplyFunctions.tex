Apply functions

A group of functions useful for avoiding loops:
lapply, sapply, apply, tapply

lapply and sapply are used to iterate along a list or a vector.

lapply( listname , length)will return a list with components the length of the components of the list.

sapply( listname , length) will return a vector with elements the lengths of the components of the list.

apply and tapply operate in a similar way on parts of arrays or
vectors.

apply and tapply have extra parameters, to indicate which part
of the array or vector to use. 

For apply it is the dimension(s) of the array over which to iterate. e.g.
apply(matrixname,2,sum,na.rm=TRUE)
will produce the sum of each column of the matrix, after missing
values have been removed.

Note how to pass extra arguments to the function to be applied.

Can be used on data frames, but will turn them into matrices first.
If there are factor variables, all the variables will end up as
character. 

cbind() will join its arguments together by columns. Likewise rbind() will join them by rows.
