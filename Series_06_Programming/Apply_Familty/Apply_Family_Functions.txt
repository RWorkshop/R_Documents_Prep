### Apply 


\section{The Apply family}

Sometimes want to apply a function to each element of a
vector/data frame/list/array.
\\
Four members: lapply, sapply, tapply, apply
\\
lapply: takes any structure and gives a list of results (hence
the `l')
\\
sapply: like lapply, but tries to simplify the result to a
vector or matrix if possible (hence the `s')
\\
apply: only used for arrays/matrices
\\
tapply: allows you to create tables (hence the `t') of values
from subgroups defined by one or more factors.
