### {The Apply family}

Sometimes want to apply a function to each element of a
vector/data frame/list/array.

Four members: lapply, sapply, tapply, apply

lapply: takes any structure and gives a list of results (hence
the `l')

sapply: like lapply, but tries to simplify the result to a
vector or matrix if possible (hence the `s')

apply: only used for arrays/matrices

tapply: allows you to create tables (hence the `t') of values
from subgroups defined by one or more factors.
