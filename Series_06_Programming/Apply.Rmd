The Apply family {data-navmenu="Programming"}
=========================================

### Apply

Sometimes want to apply a function to each element of a vector/data frame/list/array.

Four members: 
1. lapply, 
2. sapply, 
3. tapply, 
4. apply

lapply: takes any structure and gives a list of results (hence the `l')

sapply: like lapply, but tries to simplify the result to a vector or matrix if possible (hence the `s')

apply: only used for arrays/matrices

tapply: allows you to create tables (hence the `t') of values from subgroups defined by one or more factors.
