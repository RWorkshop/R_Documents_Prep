The null hypothesis is that the correlation coefficient is zero. 

The alternative hypothesis is that the correlation coefficients is greater than zero. 

The slope and intercept estimates 

These tests are given in the "Two Tailed" format. 
The one tailed format compares a null hypothesis where the parameter of interest has a true value of less than or equalt to one versus an alternative hypothesis stating that it has a value greater than zero.
